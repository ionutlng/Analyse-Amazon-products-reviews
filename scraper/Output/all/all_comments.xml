So&#539;ul meu, eu &#537;i cei doi copii mai mari ai no&#537;tri (14 &#537;i 9) avem iPhone 11 &#537;i apoi am un iPad nou pe care copilul meu de 5 ani &#238;l are de cele mai multe ori. El este foarte atent cu el, DAR are obiceiul s&#259; &#238;ndoaie cablul &#238;nc&#259;rc&#259;torului &#238;n port atunci c&#226;nd se &#238;ncarc&#259;. Este o problem&#259; obi&#537;nuit&#259; pentru toat&#259; lumea, dar m-a surprins c&#259; cablul care a venit cu ea nu a durat, dar poate 2 luni. Nu a fost dur cu el &#537;i nu l-a &#8222;&#238;ndoit&#8221; &#238;ntr-un mod care a f&#259;cut s&#259; prezinte daune vizibile, dar presupun c&#259; cablurile Apple nu sunt f&#259;cute la fel de durabile pe c&#226;t ai crede. Ca s&#259; nu mai vorbim c&#259; lungimea este prea scurt&#259; &#238;n opinia mea. Nu am vrut un alt cablu Apple bc cu privire la modul &#238;n care a durat primul (&#238;n ceea ce prive&#537;te durabilitatea) &#537;i am dat peste acesta. Recenziile au fost grozave, a&#537;a c&#259; am mers cu ea &#537;i iat&#259;-ne. &#206;n primul r&#226;nd, a fost mult mai lung dec&#226;t cel Apple &#537;i cu siguran&#539;&#259; a fost &#238;mbun&#259;t&#259;&#539;it. Este foarte clar c&#259; acesta a fost realizat av&#226;nd &#238;n vedere durabilitatea. Am observat chiar c&#259;, atunci c&#226;nd fiul meu revine la prostul obicei de a &#238;ndoaie cablul (se &#238;nt&#226;mpl&#259; &#238;n principal dac&#259; &#238;l joac&#259; &#238;n timp ce este pe &#238;nc&#259;rc&#259;tor), acesta nu se &#238;ndoaie la fel de u&#537;or ca cel de la Apple. De asemenea, se &#238;ncarc&#259; mult mai repede. Nu &#537;tiu cum, dar cu siguran&#539;&#259; o face! Chiar &#537;i atunci c&#226;nd &#238;n ma&#537;in&#259; este conectat la unul dintre porturile de &#238;nc&#259;rcare USB, &#238;nc&#259;rc&#259;torul Apple real nu s-ar &#8222;&#238;nc&#259;rca deloc&#8221; deloc ..... acesta a reu&#537;it s&#259; ia iPad-ul de la 8% la 29% &#238;n cel mai scurt timp se uita la un film pe care &#238;l recomand. 100% recomand acest lucru. Deoarece nu am avut acest lucru pentru o perioad&#259; lung&#259; de timp, voi actualiza aceast&#259; recenzie dac&#259; nu se men&#539;ine pe termen lung .... dar cum func&#539;ioneaz&#259; acum &#238;n compara&#539;ie cu modul &#238;n care a f&#259;cut deja cablul original, mi-a fost op&#539;iune mai bun&#259;.

De la un teleobiectiv mai vechi (non VR) 70-300 la un ochi de 10,5 mm. &#206;n ultimii trei ani am folosit &#537;i Nikkor 50mm 1.8D &#8222;nifty 50&#8221;. Acest obiectiv a fost uimitor pentru portrete, unele fotografii ocazionale &#537;i evenimente sportive ocazionale pentru copii. O problem&#259; pe care am &#238;nt&#226;lnit-o de nenum&#259;rate ori, pentru c&#259; filmez pe o camer&#259; senzor decupat&#259; (D90), este c&#259; 50mm 1.8D (lu&#226;nd &#238;n considerare factorul de recoltare de 1,5x) filmeaz&#259; mai mult ca un echivalent de 75mm. De nenum&#259;rate ori mi-a&#537; fi dat seama c&#259; sunt capabil s&#259; p&#259;strez un singur subiect &#238;n cadru, sau s&#259;-mi doresc s&#259; am mai mult spa&#539;iu &#238;n spatele meu pentru a face o copie de rezerv&#259; mai departe, pentru a ob&#539;ine mai mult &#238;n cadru. Deseori schimbam obiectivele &#537;i foloseam un kit mai vechi (18-70mm 3.5ED) pentru a fotografia mai larg, dar, desigur, a costat costul pierderii clarit&#259;&#539;ii &#537;i a efectului dramatic de ad&#226;ncime de c&#226;mp care poate fi realizat cu prime lentile precum 50mm 1.8D.De asemenea, un fotograf profesionist prieten de-al meu folosea un 50mm pe Canon 5D Mark III &#537;i, dup&#259; ce m-am uitat la imagini, m-am &#238;ntrebat cum a putut s&#259; se potriveasc&#259; at&#226;t de mult &#238;n cadru, f&#259;r&#259; a fi nevoie s&#259; se &#238;ntoarc&#259; dramatic. Acest lucru a fost &#238;nainte s&#259; &#537;tiu ceva despre camerele cu senzori de decupare, factorii de decupare, camerele cu cadru complet, etc. Faptul este c&#259; un obiectiv de 50 mm pe o camer&#259; cu cadru complet &#537;i acela&#537;i obiectiv pe o camer&#259; cu senzor de decupare nu filmeaz&#259; &#238;n acela&#537;i mod. citind &#537;i investig&#226;nd, am decis s&#259; ap&#259;s pe tr&#259;gaci &#537;i s&#259; cump&#259;r acest obiectiv de 35 mm 1.8G. L-am &#238;n&#539;eles, am dat bine pe obiectivul stil baionet&#259; &#537;i am &#238;nceput s&#259; filmez. Pe o camer&#259; cu senzor decupat&#259;, cum ar fi D90 (precum &#537;i cele mai noi D7200, D7000, D3300, D3200, D5500 etc.), acest obiectiv filmeaz&#259; (cu multiplicatorul factorului de recoltare de 1,5x) func&#539;ioneaz&#259; aproape de un echivalent de 53 mm. Rezultatele au fost imediate, filmez &#238;n apropiere cu copii, animale de companie, trupe &#537;i capacitatea de a se potrivi mai mult &#238;n cadru a fost - eliberatoare. Nu m-am sim&#539;it &#238;mpiedicat de ceea ce a&#537; putea sau nu a&#537; putea &#238;ncadra &#238;n cadru Pro: - Se simte bine construit - Vine ambalat cu hus&#259; de transport, capac bun, glug&#259; &#238;n stil baionet&#259; - Se poate potrivi mai mult &#238;n cadru - Rapid - Capteaz&#259; imagini clare cu o mul&#539;ime de detalii - Excelent la lumin&#259; slab&#259;, poate chiar mai bun dec&#226;t acum mai vechi de 50 mm 1.8D (care, apropo, nu se focalizeaz&#259; automat dac&#259; nu ave&#539;i o camer&#259; cu un motor de focalizare &#238;ncorporat) - Dac&#259; a&#537; avea o camer&#259; care nu avea un motor de focalizare &#238;ncorporat, nicio problem&#259;, acest obiectiv are un motor de focalizare &#238;ncorporat - Focalizarea este SILEN&#538;IOS - spre deosebire de 50mm 1.8D, care urm&#259;re&#537;te focalizarea &#537;i este zgomotoas&#259; ca iadul - Anulare manual&#259; a focaliz&#259;rii: un comutator pe partea lateral&#259; a obiectivul v&#259; permite fie s&#259; focaliza&#539;i manual obiectivul, fie s&#259; permite&#539;i M / A, manual &#537;i focalizarea automat&#259;.

Am o Nikon D3100 (o camer&#259; DSLR destul de simpl&#259;) care a venit cu obiectivul kitului (18mm-55mm). Lentila kitului este &#8222;ok&#8221;. Se face treaba, dar las&#259; de dorit. Anterior cump&#259;rasem un obiectiv Sigma 70mm-300mm zoom cu Macro &#537;i a fost un obiectiv bun. Acest obiectiv fix Nikon de 35mm a suflat celelalte 2 obiective din ap&#259; din punct de vedere al calit&#259;&#539;ii, iar bokehul (fundalul neclar) este foarte bine. Acest obiectiv este foarte clar &#537;i face doar fotografii uimitoare peste obiectivul kit care a venit cu camera mea. Diafragma 1.8 este ceea ce face pentru aceast&#259; camer&#259;. Pentru pre&#539;, nu pute&#539;i bate deloc acest obiectiv, mai ales dac&#259; ave&#539;i un buget.

Pe sistemul DX, 35 mm corespund aproximativ unei distan&#539;e focale normale de 50 mm (echivalent format complet). Unghiul de vedere se apropie de cel al ochiului uman &#537;i este utilizat &#238;n multe zone.De&#537;i obiectivul poate fi folosit &#537;i pe DSLR &#238;n format FX, senzorul nu este complet iluminat &#537;i ar trebui s&#259; fie activat modul de decupare pe camer&#259;. Desigur, acest lucru &#238;nseamn&#259; c&#259; nu mai ave&#539;i dimensiunea senzorului pentru &#238;ntregul format, oricine de&#539;ine deja obiectivul &#238;n momentul trecerii la FX &#238;l poate folosi &#238;n continuare &#238;n acest mod. Not&#259; lateral&#259;: &#206;n timpul cercet&#259;rilor mele &#238;nainte de a-mi cump&#259;ra propriul, am g&#259;sit declara&#539;ia &#238;ntr-un raport de testare care iluminarea obiectivului este relativ mare &#537;i, prin urmare, pe formatul complet, &#238;n loc de marginile negre, exist&#259; &#8222;numai&#8221; vignetare mai puternic&#259;. Deci, pute&#539;i utiliza formatul complet sau de ex. func&#539;ioneaz&#259; numai cu Crop 1.2 &#238;n loc de 1.5 (DX). Deoarece nu am reu&#537;it &#238;nc&#259; s&#259; &#238;ncerc asta (eu nu de&#539;in &#238;nc&#259; o camer&#259; FX), v&#259; rog s&#259; o accepta&#539;i cu precau&#539;ie! ********* Procesare / haptice / accesorii: (4 stele) Obiectivul este din plastic, se simte dar tot merit&#259;. Nimic nu sun&#259; sau nu are un joc vizibil. &#206;n afar&#259; de plastic, obiectivul vine cu o baionet&#259; metalic&#259; &#537;i o buz&#259; de etan&#537;are, care ofer&#259; protec&#539;ie &#238;mpotriva stropirii apei. &#206;n plus, firul filtrului este realizat din metal. Deci, nu trebuie s&#259; v&#259; face&#539;i griji cu privire la deteriorarea firului obiectivului atunci c&#226;nd utiliza&#539;i filtre. &#206;n general, procesarea este la un nivel ridicat. Singurul punct de critic&#259; pentru mine este inelul de focalizare, care poate fi controlat fin, dar face o impresie prea ieftin&#259; &#537;i emite o acustic&#259; t&#226;r&#226;toare. Av&#226;nd &#238;n vedere pre&#539;ul &#537;i restul calit&#259;&#539;ii, nu este un criteriu decisiv pentru mine, dar &#238;n acest moment ar putea fi &#238;mbun&#259;t&#259;&#539;it. Pe l&#226;ng&#259; obiectivul &#238;n sine, un parasolar, capacul obiectivului (fa&#539;&#259; + spate) &#537;i o geant&#259; de p&#226;nz&#259; pentru protec&#539;ie. ******** * Calitatea / func&#539;ionalitatea imaginii: (4 stele) Cel mai important lucru despre optic&#259; este, desigur, calitatea &#537;i func&#539;ionalitatea imaginii. Aici ve&#539;i ob&#539;ine o distan&#539;&#259; focal&#259; fix&#259; \u200b\u200brapid&#259;, cu - pe baza pre&#539;ului - performan&#539;e optice remarcabile. &#206;n compara&#539;ie cu pre&#539;ul sc&#259;zut, exist&#259; totu&#537;i abera&#539;ii existente, o u&#537;oar&#259; distorsiune, o claritate oarecum mai moale a imaginii atunci c&#226;nd este deschis&#259; &#537;i un stabilizator de imagine lips&#259;. &#238;n cazul unei expuneri mai lungi oricum cu un trepied. Personal, nu &#238;mi lipse&#537;te stabilizatorul de imagine, dar ar trebui s&#259; fii con&#537;tient de acest lucru atunci c&#226;nd alegi timpul de expunere. Este cu siguran&#539;&#259; un lucru pl&#259;cut, dar ar fi asociat cu un pre&#539; mai mare &#537;i, prin urmare, neinteresant &#238;n opinia mea. O scar&#259; de focalizare, cum ar fi cunoscut de la 50mm F1.8G, ar fi totu&#537;i frumos s&#259; &#238;l ai. Cu toate acestea, eu personal folosesc acest lucru doar pentru o setare grosier&#259; la infinit. Cei care fotografiaz&#259; o mul&#539;ime de arhitectur&#259; au de-a face cu aceasta, mai pu&#539;in relevant&#259; pentru alte aplica&#539;ii: Distorsiune. &#206;nc&#259; consider c&#259; distorsiunea este acceptabil&#259;, deoarece acest lucru se &#238;nt&#226;mpl&#259; cu corec&#539;ia intern&#259; a camerei / profilurile camerei de pe computer &#537;i par&#539;ial &#206;n plus, editarea imaginilor poate fi complet eliminat&#259;. Cu o distan&#539;&#259; focal&#259; fix&#259; \u200b\u200b&#238;n acest interval de distan&#539;&#259; focal&#259;, personal m-a&#537; a&#537;tepta la o distorsiune mai mic&#259;. Distorsiunea nu va fi vizibil&#259; &#238;n domenii precum fotografia de peisaj sau portrete. (3 stele) Abera&#539;iile cromatice apar la margini cu contraste puternice, dar sunt &#238;n general vizibile doar la un factor de m&#259;rire ridicat. (4 stele) ------ Claritate, bokeh &#537;i intensitatea luminii (5 stele) Datorit&#259; importan&#539;ei sale, aceast&#259; zon&#259; merit&#259; propria sec&#539;iune pentru mine. Claritatea general&#259; a obiectivului este foarte bun&#259;. C&#226;nd diafragma este &#238;nc&#259; pu&#539;in mai moale, ob&#539;ine&#539;i o claritate foarte mare p&#226;n&#259; la detalii &#537;i imagini cu contrast ridicat c&#226;nd v&#259; opri&#539;i. &#206;n compara&#539;ie, modelul F1.8G de 50 mm este pu&#539;in mai clar aici. Autofocusul - ar trebui verificat individual pentru FIECARE lentil&#259; - se potrive&#537;te perfect &#537;i rapid &#238;n cazul meu. Cu deschiderea deschis&#259; F1.8, zona de focalizare poate fi controlat&#259; fin, iar obiectele sau persoanele pot fi frumos expuse. Aici intervine importan&#539;a bokeh-ului. Personal &#238;mi place acest lucru foarte mult pentru un obiectiv din aceast&#259; gam&#259; de pre&#539;uri. Bokehul este frumos &#537;i moale &#537;i pl&#259;cut calm. C&#226;nd diafragma este deschis&#259;, cercurile de lumin&#259; sunt frumos afi&#537;ate &#238;n ciuda singurelor 7 lamele cu diafragm&#259; &#537;i formeaz&#259; o tranzi&#539;ie fin&#259; c&#259;tre restul fundalului. &#206;n special cu portretele, merg adesea la F2.8 pentru a ob&#539;ine o gam&#259; mai mare de focalizare &#537;i, &#238;n general, un grad mai mare de claritate, &#238;n timp ce am &#238;nc&#259; un bokeh frumos. Ca de obicei, cu c&#226;t te opre&#537;ti mai departe, calitatea bokeh-ului scade, de asemenea. Optimul depinde de o serie de factori &#537;i mai ales de gustul personal. (5 stele) Cu o intensitate a luminii de F1.8 &#537;i o calitate optic&#259; deja bun&#259; cu aceast&#259; deschidere, obiectivul este ideal pentru fotografierea &#238;n camere mai pu&#539;in bine iluminate, la evenimente &#537;i, &#238;n general, pentru zona &#8222;Lumina disponibil&#259;&#8221;. Pentru acesta din urm&#259;, mai ales &#238;n combina&#539;ie cu bokeh, un obiectiv foarte pl&#259;cut. (5 stele) Am ata&#537;at 3 imagini pentru a evalua bokehul &#238;n zona de lumin&#259; disponibil&#259;. Acestea vizeaz&#259; pur &#537;i simplu bokehul &#537;i nu claritatea obiectivului, deoarece, &#238;n opinia mea, acest lucru poate fi slab reprezentat cu imaginile de pe Amazon. A&#537; dori s&#259; observ c&#259; sursele de lumin&#259; nu sunt perfect circulare, ceea ce &#238;nseamn&#259; c&#259;, &#238;n func&#539;ie de unghiul de inciden&#539;&#259;, bokehul nu poate &#238;nf&#259;&#539;i&#537;a cercuri rotunde. Sunt afi&#537;ate F1.8, f2.8 &#537;i F5. Se vede clar formarea stelelor &#238;n sursele de lumin&#259; directe pentru F5. Cu F1.8 &#537;i F2.8 ave&#539;i &#238;n continuare o structur&#259; circular&#259; frumoas&#259; a luminilor. &#206;n plus, aceasta nu ar trebui s&#259; fie o referin&#539;&#259; pentru fotografia mea sau utilizarea principal&#259; a acestui obiectiv. ********* Una peste alta, pentru mine &#537;i aplica&#539;ia mea, un obiectiv absolut remarcabil, cu un raport pre&#539; / performan&#539;&#259; extrem de bun. Pentru mine o distan&#539;&#259; focal&#259; pe care ar trebui s&#259; o aib&#259; toat&#259; lumea &#537;i cel pu&#539;in majoritatea cititorilor de aici vor putea s&#259; o ia f&#259;r&#259; griji. Datorit&#259; abaterilor de la fabricarea lentilelor, ar trebui s&#259; efectua&#539;i propriile teste, &#238;n special &#238;n ceea ce prive&#537;te focalizarea automat&#259; &#537;i - dac&#259; nu se potrive&#537;te bine - obiectivul ar trebui schimbat. Am testat acum 2 dintre aceste obiective, iar focalizarea automat&#259; a fost precis&#259; &#537;i nu a fost schimbat&#259; pe ambele. Pe baza acestui mic e&#537;antion (&#537;i, prin urmare, nu reprezentativ), Nikon pare s&#259; fac&#259; o treab&#259; bun&#259; aici. &#206;n general, &#238;i dau 4 stele, prin care critica este absolut imbatabil&#259; la nivel ridicat &#537;i pre&#539; / performan&#539;&#259;! Sensibilitatea inelului de focalizare, precum &#537;i distorsiunea existent&#259; cu o distan&#539;&#259; focal&#259; fix&#259; \u200b\u200bcu aceast&#259; distan&#539;&#259; focal&#259; sunt &#238;n cele din urm&#259; responsabile pentru deducerea punctului. Performan&#539;a optic&#259; &#238;n ceea ce prive&#537;te claritatea &#537;i bokehul justific&#259;, de asemenea, 5 stele. A&#537; dori s&#259; subliniez c&#259; evaluarea se bazeaz&#259; pe experien&#539;a mea personal&#259; &#537;i pe &#238;nregistr&#259;rile f&#259;cute p&#226;n&#259; acum (&#238;n ultimele 6 luni). &#206;n consecin&#539;&#259;, acestea sunt impresii din utilizarea real&#259; &#537;i nu rezultate de laborator. &#206;n plus, pre&#539;ul este &#238;ntotdeauna inclus &#238;n evaluare. Scump nu este &#238;ntotdeauna mai bun, dar mai ales c&#226;nd vine vorba de procesare, pur &#537;i simplu v&#259; a&#537;tepta&#539;i mai mult de la un obiectiv de 1000 &#8364; dec&#226;t de la un &lt;200 &#8364;. --------------------- +++ Acord o mare importan&#539;&#259; p&#259;rerii altor clien&#539;i &#537;i sunt fericit c&#226;nd pot ajuta cu o decizie cu experien&#539;a mea. Prin urmare, &#238;mi iau mult timp pentru o analiz&#259; de zi cu zi onest&#259;, cuprinz&#259;toare &#537;i, sper&#259;m, util&#259;. +++</review><review> 'Mul&#539;i fotografi amatori se str&#259;duiesc s&#259; ob&#539;in&#259; cele mai puternice obiective zoom &#537;i uit&#259; de avantajele distan&#539;elor focale fixe. Obiectivul evaluat aici nu trebuie s&#259; lipseasc&#259; &#238;n nicio pung&#259; foto, deoarece &#238;n multe situa&#539;ii ofer&#259; pur &#537;i simplu rezultate mai bune ale imaginii. Ar trebui s&#259; ajunge&#539;i la punctul de a lua &#238;n considerare dac&#259; &#537;i &#238;n ce situa&#539;ii ave&#539;i cu adev&#259;rat nevoie de un zoom. Cu o distan&#539;&#259; focal&#259; fix&#259;, picioarele devin un zoom &#537;i v&#259; deplasa&#539;i spre obiect. Are loc un proces decizional mult mai extins, se creeaz&#259; alte perspective &#537;i, &#238;n final, imagini mai bune. Pentru c&#259; s&#259; fim sinceri - multe obiective pot fi &#8222;m&#259;rite&#8221; prin simpla apropiere. Un alt avantaj este greutatea. Cine nu o &#537;tie, un reflex oglind&#259; pentru pozele cu adev&#259;rat grozave, dar apoi &#8222;micile instantanee&#8221; pentru turul de vacan&#539;&#259;. Compara&#539;i c&#226;t de u&#537;or este SLR brusc f&#259;r&#259; un teleobiectiv greu.

Un alt avantaj sunt rezultatele semnificativ mai bune &#238;n condi&#539;ii de iluminare dificile, de exemplu &#238;n interior sau &#238;n vreme acoperit&#259;, &#238;ncep&#226;nd cu amurgul etc. Obiectivele teleobiective &#537;i aici obiectivul marcheaz&#259; foarte bine. Obiectivul este, de asemenea, ideal pentru a face portrete. Una peste alta, pot recomanda tuturor s&#259; lucreze &#537;i s&#259; &#238;ncerce cu acest obiectiv m&#259;car o vreme. Dac&#259; cineva mi-ar fi sugerat s&#259; cump&#259;r un obiectiv prim cu c&#226;&#539;iva ani &#238;n urm&#259;, a&#537; fi fluturat m&#226;na &#537;i a&#537; fi crezut c&#259;, cu kitul meu teleobiectiv, a&#537; putea face totul. Acest lucru este cu siguran&#539;&#259; adev&#259;rat, dar un obiectiv primar poate face mult mai bine. &#206;n general, trebuie s&#259; spunem c&#259; beneficiile sunt enorme, calitatea obiectivului este cu adev&#259;rat excelent&#259; &#537;i pre&#539;ul este absolut &#238;n regul&#259;! &#206;l pot recomanda!</review><review> 'Sunt foarte &#238;nc&#226;ntat s&#259; am acest obiectiv ca primul meu obiectiv principal!

Am cump&#259;rat acest lucru dup&#259; recenzii despre c&#226;t de bun este fluxul de aer &#537;i toate avantajele acestui caz.

Carcasele NZXT arat&#259; mult mai bine, dar sacrific&#259; fluxul de aer pentru aspect. Un lucru care m-a surprins a fost c&#259; ventilatoarele trebuiau conectate separat la placa de baz&#259;, necesit&#226;nd trei conectori diferi&#539;i &#238;n partea superioar&#259; a conectorului r&#259;citorului de procesor.

Cred c&#259; carcasa are, de asemenea, o lumin&#259; care clipe&#537;te pentru a ar&#259;ta starea HDD-ului - nu l-am conectat la placa de baz&#259;, deoarece ar putea deveni deranjant. Pentru a controla ventilatoarele carcasei, le-am setat s&#259; se bazeze pe CPU. temperaturile &#537;i a f&#259;cut ca ventilatoarele s&#259; urce &#537;i s&#259; coboare datorit&#259; faptului c&#259; seria Ryzen 3000 are o scurt&#259; explozie de cre&#537;tere a temperaturii. Pentru referin&#539;&#259;, folosesc o plac&#259; Gigabyte Aorus Elite X570 cu Ryzen 7 3700X. Am decis acum s&#259; bazez ventilatoarele carcasei pe senzorul PCIE_16 de pe placa de baz&#259; &#537;i s&#259; le pun ventilatoarele la aproximativ 950-1000 RPM &#238;n utilizare normal&#259;, ceea ce nu este tare, dar odat&#259; ce a&#539;i &#238;nceput s&#259; trece&#539;i peste asta, este destul de tare. C&#226;nd PCIE_16-ul meu atinge 40 de grade Celsius, am o urcare abrupt&#259; de p&#226;n&#259; la 100% din utilizarea ventilatorului (aproximativ 1325 RPM), ceea ce ar fi &#238;n mod normal c&#226;nd joc.

Culorile pot fi controlate prin intermediul software-ului, dar nu am reu&#537;it s&#259; func&#539;ioneze cu ASUS Aura, a&#537;a c&#259; am decis s&#259; folosesc software-ul pl&#259;cii mele , ceea ce nu mi-a pl&#259;cut. Rulez RGB pe butonul din partea din fa&#539;&#259; a carcasei. &#206;n general, a fost un caz bun &#537;i temperaturile sunt reci. RAM-ul meu se afl&#259; la 45 de grade (l&#226;ng&#259; cea mai rece), iar cele mai apropiate odat&#259; cu ventilatoarele sunt cu 2-3 grade mai cool la jocuri, altfel stau la 32-37 de grade.</review><review> 'Acest caz este foarte bun.

Instalarea a fost u&#537;oar&#259; &#537;i eram &#238;n func&#539;iune &#238;n mai pu&#539;in de 20 de minute cu o re&#539;ea de plas&#259; a tuturor celor trei puncte de acces. Am o proprietate de 11K ft2 cu structuri multiple. Am pus unitatea principal&#259; de router (care a fost conectat&#259; la re&#539;eaua mea prin Ethernet) la un cap&#259;t al casei mele principale &#537;i am pus o alt&#259; unitate de satelit la cel&#259;lalt cap&#259;t al casei mele principale. Am pus a doua unitate de satelit &#238;n garajul meu (structur&#259; separat&#259; &#238;n col&#539;ul propriet&#259;&#539;ii). Teste de vitez&#259;: &#238;n diferite loca&#539;ii din jurul propriet&#259;&#539;ii de pe un laptop Mac OS au fost urm&#259;toarele: Din orice loca&#539;ie din casa principal&#259; am reu&#537;it s&#259; ob&#539;in viteze u&#537;or. dep&#259;&#537;ind 100 Mbps. Cel mai mare a fost de 140 Mbps. Din garajul meu &#537;i din loca&#539;iile din curtea mea, aproape de garaj, am putut ob&#539;ine viteze de p&#226;n&#259; la 50 Mbps (media a fost de aproximativ 44 Mbps). Viteze decente. Numai pe baza vitezei, a&#537; spune c&#259; Google prime&#537;te 3 stele, deoarece am auzit de viteze mult mai bune de la sistemele radio cu plas&#259; dubl&#259;, dar totu&#537;i, 43MBps la cap&#259;tul extrem al mesh-ului sunt suficiente pentru streaming video. oprit acolo. Problema principal&#259; pe care am avut-o cu sistemul a fost c&#259; este conceput&#259; strict pentru persoanele care au o &#238;n&#539;elegere sau un interes absolut zero pentru re&#539;eaua de calculatoare &#537;i este foarte limitat&#259; &#238;n modul &#238;n care v&#259; pute&#539;i configura re&#539;eaua. Software-ul pe care &#238;l instala&#539;i pe telefonul dvs. depune eforturi mari pentru a v&#259; proteja de toate detaliile tehnice. Acest lucru ar putea fi un lucru bun pentru unii &#537;i acesta a fost &#238;ntr-adev&#259;r unul dintre motivele pentru care am achizi&#539;ionat acest sistem (deoarece so&#539;ia mea a vrut ceva pe care s&#259;-l poat&#259; rezolva c&#226;nd am plecat &#537;i &#537;tie zero &#537;i &#238;i pas&#259; zero de re&#539;elele de calculatoare). este o limit&#259; a c&#226;t de simplu se poate sau ar trebui s&#259; se fac&#259; ceva care este fundamental complex din punct de vedere tehnic. &#206;n opinia mea, Google trece linia cu acest sistem, &#238;ncerc&#226;nd s&#259; furnizeze configurarea &#537;i gestionarea wifi &#238;ntr-un ambalaj de mesaje non-tehnice pentru consumatori, similar cu ceea ce a&#539;i putea g&#259;si &#238;n aplica&#539;ia dvs. Facebook. Iat&#259; c&#226;teva exemple: Configurare re&#539;ea: sistemul configureaz&#259; o re&#539;ea IP automat f&#259;r&#259; a v&#259; solicita o adres&#259; IP sau o subre&#539;ea, o gam&#259; DHCP sau orice altceva dec&#226;t numele SSID. Face acela&#537;i lucru cu securitatea wifi. Pute&#539;i schimba adresele IP ulterior &#238;n sec&#539;iunea de set&#259;ri avansate, dar nu &#537;i securitatea wifi. Ave&#539;i un anumit tip de securitate wifi pe care &#238;l dori&#539;i? sau sunte&#539;i curios ce folose&#537;te Google? &#206;mi pare r&#259;u. Nu am putut vedea nici o modalitate de a seta set&#259;rile de securitate Wifi sau de a le schimba. Solu&#539;ia Google pare s&#259; fie doar s&#259; &#238;ncerca&#539;i s&#259; muta&#539;i pod-urile wifi &#238;n diferite locuri. Acum pentru cel mai r&#259;u: routerul. Deci, &#238;n revizuirea CNET pe care am citit-o, a precizat &#238;n mod clar c&#259; Google Wifi poate fi utilizat fie &#238;n modul bridge, fie ca router / gateway direct la modemul dvs. &#206;ntruc&#226;t am deja un router Ubiquiti de &#238;nalt&#259; performan&#539;&#259;, aceast&#259; revizuire a fost important&#259; pentru mine, deoarece a &#238;nsemnat c&#259; pot implementa Google Wifi doar ca o solu&#539;ie de re&#539;ea wifi &#537;i s&#259; nu deranjez re&#539;eaua sau ruterul meu cu cablu de &#238;nalt&#259; performan&#539;&#259;. Adev&#259;rul este (destul de hilar) destul de diferit. Aceast&#259; solu&#539;ie din testarea mea func&#539;ioneaz&#259; DOAR ca un router / gateway care &#238;nlocuie&#537;te routerul dvs. existent. TREBUIE s&#259; se conecteze direct la modem pentru ca acesta s&#259; func&#539;ioneze a&#537;a cum a fost proiectat. Func&#539;ionalitatea routerului ofer&#259; o re&#539;ea de nivel 2 care nu poate fi configurat&#259; sau oprit&#259;. Deci, dac&#259; ave&#539;i deja un router, sunte&#539;i blocat cu NAT dublu &#537;i toate problemele pe care acesta le aduce. Acum partea hilar&#259;. De fapt, exist&#259; o setare &#238;n sec&#539;iunea de set&#259;ri avansate de configurare a re&#539;elei, care v&#259; permite s&#259; comuta&#539;i sistemul &#238;n modul bridge. Dar nic&#259;ieri &#238;n timpul configur&#259;rii nu v&#259; ofer&#259; posibilitatea de a face acest lucru. Nu simte c&#259; ave&#539;i deja o configurare a re&#539;elei de nivel 2. Pur &#537;i simplu merge &#238;nainte &#537;i configureaz&#259; propriul router, gateway &#537;i re&#539;ea. Apoi, atunci c&#226;nd &#238;ncerca&#539;i s&#259;-l schimba&#539;i &#238;n modul bridge mai t&#226;rziu, comutatorul de comutare este gri &#537;i exist&#259; un singur link pe care se poate face clic pe pagina care spune &#8222;Modul dispozitivului a fost setat automat. Afla&#539;i mai multe&#8221;. dup&#259; ce face&#539;i clic pe acesta, v&#259; duce&#539;i la un articol de ajutor detaliat pe care sunt obligat s&#259; &#238;l lipesc aici &#238;n &#238;ntregime, astfel &#238;nc&#226;t s&#259;-i salva&#539;i pe al&#539;ii ca mine o mul&#539;ime de timp pierdut: &#8222;Modul Bridge Majoritatea oamenilor nu vor avea nevoie de modul Bridge, dar pentru cei care au, am prezentat mai jos c&#226;teva configur&#259;ri recomandate. C&#226;nd se utilizeaz&#259; modul Bridge: modul Bridge este necesar numai atunci c&#226;nd &#238;nt&#226;mpin&#259; cazuri specifice de Double NAT. Pentru majoritatea oamenilor, Double NAT nu afecteaz&#259; performan&#539;a Wi-Fi. Dar poate fi o problem&#259; dac&#259; juca&#539;i jocuri online sau utiliza&#539;i atribuiri de adrese IP, reguli de redirec&#539;ionare a porturilor &#537;i UPnP. Afla&#539;i mai multe despre Double NAT &#537;i c&#226;nd este posibil s&#259; ave&#539;i nevoie de modul Bridge. Google Wifi accept&#259; modul Bridge? Da, dar va func&#539;iona numai dac&#259; utiliza&#539;i un singur Punct Wifi. Dac&#259; crea&#539;i o re&#539;ea mesh cu mai multe puncte Wifi, punctul dvs. Wifi principal nu poate fi &#238;n modul Bridge. Acest lucru se datoreaz&#259; faptului c&#259; punctul Wifi primar trebuie s&#259; fac&#259; lucruri speciale pentru a controla set&#259;rile &#537;i comunicarea &#238;n cadrul re&#539;elei Wi-Fi. Dac&#259; este &#238;n modul bridge, ve&#539;i pierde o parte din G Func&#539;iile cheie ale oogle Wifi. Cum activez modul bridge? Dac&#259; utiliza&#539;i doar un singur punct Google Wifi &#537;i Double NAT cauzeaz&#259; probleme, ave&#539;i dou&#259; op&#539;iuni: Activa&#539;i modul bridge pe modemul / routerul furnizat de ISP (RECOMANDAT) Activa&#539;i modul bridge pe punctul dvs. Wifi principal (NU SE RECOMAND&#258; &#8222;OK! Grozav. Deci, pe scurt, dac&#259; juca&#539;i jocuri online, utiliza&#539;i UPnP, ave&#539;i orice configurare de redirec&#539;ionare a porturilor sau ave&#539;i IP-uri atribuite, sau permite&#539;i-mi s&#259; adaug tip&#259;ri&#539;i! .. (de pe orice dispozitiv conectat la routerul furnizat de ISP) ... CANT pute&#539;i utiliza Google Wifi ca sistem mesh! Partea hilar&#259; este c&#259; comutatorul de comutare este chiar acolo! De ce s&#259; nu facem acest lucru clar pentru oamenii din fa&#539;&#259;?!?! Concluzia acestui sistem NU este doar un sistem de re&#539;ea wifi. Este o re&#539;ea acas&#259; ALL-IN-ONE. Ve&#539;i avea nevoie de tot ce ave&#539;i &#238;n cas&#259; pentru a fi conectat la re&#539;eaua Google wifi sau conectat la unul dintre porturile LAN furnizate pe unul dintre podurile Google wifi. (Fiecare pod Google v&#259; ofer&#259; dou&#259; porturi LAN acceptate pentru cel care ac&#539;ioneaz&#259; ca router care v&#259; ofer&#259; unul. Deci, de ce este at&#226;t de r&#259;u? Ei bine, pentru &#238;ncep&#259;tori, func&#539;ionalitatea routerului &#238;n sine va deveni g&#226;tul sticlei &#238;n re&#539;eaua dvs. destul de u&#537;or dac&#259; ave&#539;i trafic dintr-o cas&#259; tipic&#259; (50 = -75 dispozitive, inclusiv IoT, camere de securitate, dispozitive mobile, console, HiFi, televizoare inteligente etc.) Chiar &#537;i cu un procesor ARM quad core (C&#259; Google face publicitate ca o caracteristic&#259; pe &#8222;permite&#539;i-v&#259; s&#259; ob&#539;ine&#539;i tehnic&#259;&#8221;) sec&#539;iunea din bro&#537;urile lor de v&#226;nz&#259;ri online), care ac&#539;ioneaz&#259; ca un punct de acces principal MESH &#537;i un gateway / router va pune prea mult&#259; povar&#259; asupra unui singur pod Google. Ciudat este c&#259; acela&#537;i compliment al computerului este irosit pe celelalte poduri ac&#539;ion&#226;nd ca sateli&#539;i. Unele alte puncte despre router: QOS -&gt; a fost redenumit &#8222;Dispozitiv prioritar&#8221; Singular nu plural. Pute&#539;i alege doar unul!

Singura op&#539;iune este s&#259; &#537;terge&#539;i &#537;i s&#259; o lua&#539;i de la cap&#259;t.

(Am intrat aici ca parte a &#238;ncerc&#259;rii mele inutile de a &#238;n&#539;elege cum a fost configurat&#259; securitatea Wifi.) Aceast&#259; sec&#539;iune are trei comutatoare de comutare, toate &#238;n mod implicit au fost activate. Ce fac ei? Din nou, m&#259; simt obligat s&#259; lipesc versiunea nelimitat&#259; aici (consulta&#539;i captura de ecran). Deci, &#238;n esen&#539;&#259;, f&#259;r&#259; a notifica utilizatorul, Google a configurat practic re&#539;eaua de sniffing la nivelul routerului de nivel 2 al re&#539;elei dvs. private &#537;i raporteaz&#259; statistici &#238;napoi la Google. ! &#536;i procesorul quad core care este deja prea &#238;mpov&#259;rat face &#537;i aceast&#259; procesare! Trebuie remarcat faptul c&#259;, spre deosebire de configurarea unui dispozitiv Apple, unde &#537;ti&#539;i, va exista acel ecran &#238;n timpul configur&#259;rii care v&#259; cere permisiunea de a activa raportarea &#238;napoi la Apple, cu acest Google Wifi nu a existat un astfel de ecran sau notificare &#238;n timpul configur&#259;rii. A &#537;i au setat DNS-ul la 8.8.8.8 &#537;i doar la 8.8.8.8. (pentru cei care nu &#537;tiu c&#259; 8.8.8.8 este principalul server public de nume de domeniu de internet Google) Toate acestea pot fi schimbate. Dar este un pic &#537;mecher &#537;i IMHO este o &#238;nc&#259;lcare a confiden&#539;ialit&#259;&#539;ii pentru a o pre-configura la cel mai sc&#259;zut nivel de confiden&#539;ialitate. Utilizatorul &#539;int&#259; non-tehnic al acestui sistem probabil c&#259; nici m&#259;car nu va &#537;ti. A&#537;adar, pe scurt, mul&#539;umim Amazon pentru politica de returnare de 30 de zile. Apreciez foarte mult &#238;ncercarea acestui sistem. &#206;i dau un rating de 2 stele pentru o persoan&#259; ca mine.

In early July 2017 we had a thunderstorm that resulted in a loss of power and a power surge.  The surge fried everything plugged into this device (LED TV, Blu-Ray player, DirecTV, internet modem, and surround sound system).  Damage cost over $1000 in replacement and repairs.  The surge protector shows that it is still protecting devices so it never tripped at all.  This device is absolutely worthless.</review><review> "This is a good unit, without a lot of frills, that's reasonably priced and by a respectable company in power protection.  You can buy a lot fancier units and if you need/want HDMI/Phone/Internet cable protection as well this isn't the unit for you, but it does have two protected USB ports and a high Joules rating.  The plugs are secure and the ability of the cord to rotate at the power strip makes for very flexible and clean cord options.  It also disconnects your devices from power in case of a large surge, where others may continue to let power through after the surge with reduced protection.  In addition it has a green LED that will show if over time or a surge that protection has been compromised in anyway, while I've read elsewhere these types of indicators should not be fully trusted it is another visual piece of mind.  APC states that should that LED indicator the unit is not working it will be replaced under warranty.  It also will indicate if there is a problem with the outlet wiring. About the only nitpick I could make is that it would be nice if the unit had more spacing between the plugs.  Seems these days no two companies can decide how they want to do their plugs/powerboxes, some are long inline with the cord others are square, and other devices just have a normal prong cord.Another thing to remember with these is their protection is limited over time.  Think of it as a bucket of water, one really big surger probably kills the unit and empties the bucket, but it may over years protect against hundreds of smaller power surges and each one of these spills a little water out of the bucket and after awhile they offer much less protection than they did when new.", "I purchased this to replace a pair of old, daisy-chained surge bars behind our TV. Overall, this is a good product with some nice, though basic features, but at a price that isn't really justified.The good:- The outer 6 ports are fantastic. They are far enough apart for even the most giant of power bricks (think SNES large)- The cord is on a swivel, allowing you some flexibility in terms of how you mount the unit. Not sure if this will prove to be a fail point if used too much, but it should hold up- Very satisfying on/off switch is unlikely to get hit by accident- Great fault protection that indicates where an electrical problem may be arising fromThe less good:- USB: The USB ports are pretty under-powered for 2020. Very few devices are all that happy at 2.4A these days. These ports will be good for powering small devices like a raspberry pi or a NES classic, but look elsewhere for charging your phone or tablet- Wall Cable: The cable is a bit on the long side if this is anywhere near the outlet. The cable is also very thick and strong, meaning it becomes a bit of a bear if you have it kicking around", "Okay, I will start off with my one 'con' for this product: One of the plug outlets on the power strip isn't usable (I can't insert a plug in it for some reason). Other than that though, everything else is a positive.This strip offers room for multiple cords to be plugged in, and the surge protection on this one is supreme. The bonus (for me) is the two USB ports that are included on it. I read several reviews stating that charge time on these are very slow, but I've found - after charging both my iPhone and my tablet on it - that the charge time is equal to (if not faster) than independent charge ports I've used. Very fast.I set up the power strip next to my bed, and have my computer connected to it, along with multiple smaller devices. So far absolutely no problems (save for that one plug, which I don't really need, since there are so many on it).  It's on the wall, and gives me access to all outlets, which is a HUGE bonus for me, as my last power strip had to be run under the bed, and was a pain to deal with any time I wanted to access it. For the price, I'd highly recommend this one for it's high level surge protection as well as the multiple outlets and two USB ports. Definitely worth the investment.", 'I own many APC power bars, so I knew that the quality would be good when I purchased this one.  The USB ports charge my iPhone 11 Pro&#128077;.  The only thing I miss are the "Always On" sockets that are on my other APC power bars, kind of handy if you need some things powered all the time and some not.  Anyway, that\'s very minor.  The power cord is 8 feet long, not 6 feet as stated in the listing.  This power bar may cost more than others, but has a joule rating of 2880, the higher the joules, the more surge suppressing ability and less damage to devices plugged into the power bar.  Sure there are a lot of cheap power bars out there, but they offer little to no protection for anything plugged into them.Happy with my purchase&#128513;'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/aovo-Beginners-Brushless-Quadcopter-Foldable/dp/B08GP9F171/ref=lp_16225009011_1_5854/132-1734952-6897126?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592355&amp;sr=1-5854#customerReviews</link><review> \ "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0Wanted longer range than Potensic D58 and a better camera and the aovo W pro delivered. The max wind I could send the D58 up in was 10 mph. On the first flight of the W pro the wind was much higher. The weather app said 11 mph but it felt more like 15 mph locally.The range of the first flight was disappointing till I found it was restricted by Novice Mode.Extended range to 500 meters in the app and then tried again.I was impressed with the speed and stability the W pro in a 15 mph wind.The video record to phone method was tested and found to be excellent. Was able to take a screenshot of the video and zoom in to see incredible detail.Battery life is excellent. Flew 2 flights totaling 10 minutes and used about 1/4 of the battery.Charging does take awhile but the battery does not get warm while charging. Rated for 30 minutes flight which seems achievable in real world conditions.Update: have made about 10 flights. Range is great. Put in a 64 gig sd card and made some movies. The resolution of the movies in 4K on the sd card is awesome. This is my 3rd drone and by far my favorite. The battery life is so long I haven't run out of battery on a flight yet.Update 11 9 2020The flight time was 30 minutes for 1sr flight.After about 3 flights the battery took longer to charge and showed only 3/4 charge after 20 hours charging.Contacted Amazon and sending it back for replacement.

It has a variety of really nice features for being able to start out flying a drone. I also enjoy that you were able to tell where the camera is based on the LED lighting at the bottom of each of the rotors, it has Green LED rings that light up for the two rear rotors, so that as you were flying you are able to tell where the front is especially in no light or low light situations. I like the design of this because you were also able to mount your smart phone for monitoring the camera and controlling it underneath the joystick controls so that it&#8217;s simple to view and you have full access to the controls you need for flying it. The brushless motors are nice that it has on it because it really helps keep the noise down as the rotors rotate and makes it so it is pleasant for your neighbors if you were flying in your backyard. It comes with a single battery that you&#8217;re able to get about 30 minutes of flight time on, depending how much video recording you were doing. Overall we&#8217;ve we&#8217;ve been very Kathy with his drone as different members of our family have learned how to fly it, and I especially like the small case that everything fits in for storing it.</review><review> "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0This Drone is so much fun, easy to set up, and has advanced technology that help unskilled pilots like me.  Of course I crashed it into the house the first time I flew it, but it took the punishment and went right back up in the air!  The app is easy to download and use, the wifi connection to my phone worked flawlessly, the battery lasted for an eternity, and I was able to get some cool pictures of our yard, my dog, and my daughter running around.  I have had at least 6 other drones, all the little 30-50 dollar jobs that pretty much suck compared to this one.  It has GPS, can follow you, and it takes off and lands by itself, which is great for when you get in trouble.  I was shocked when everything worked just as advertised - like literally I gasped as the video from the drone's camera was displayed on my phone, and almost squealed when it landed itself in a bit of a cross breeze in a tight part of my yard.  There are more features to explore on this thing - can't wait to fly some more!"</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_sp_btf_kitchen-intl-ship_sr_pg26_1?ie=UTF8&amp;adId=A05143491ZPPCI58PILKJ&amp;url=%2FReversible-All-Season-Bedspread-Pattern-Collection%2Fdp%2FB083F2CSYZ%2Fref%3Dsr_1_631_sspa%3Fdchild%3D1%26keywords%3DHome%2Bbedding%26qid%3D1605596570%26s%3Dkitchen-intl-ship%26sr%3D1-631-spons%26psc%3D1&amp;qualifier=1605596570&amp;id=6251223918576078&amp;widgetName=sp_btf</link><review> \ "We have a queen size bed but I decided to order the king rather than the full/queen because I prefer it drapes to the floor.

This is larger but does not go to the floor as shown in the picture.  The sides are almost to floor but foot of bed just covers the top mattress.  Definitely will need a dust ruffle.  The colors are beautiful and light blue, navy and white as described.  I would not agree this is a quilt, more of a coverlet, although the stitching is quilted..

Overall, it is a good value for the price if you are needing something lightweight.</review><review> 'So disappointed! The pictures and description lead you to believe that this is a soft Aqua, blue and grey which would have been perfect for my room.

The fabric is like the sheets in a $10.00 motel and the pattern on the shams is different. You can find nicer sets at you local big box store for less money.The one positive I can give this is that it&#8217;s perfect for late spring thru early fall weather. It&#8217;s light enough to be cool in the summertime, (might make a good *keep it in the car picnic/ beach blanket* but warm enough to fend off the first cool nights of spring and fall.All that said I still returned it because for $50.00 bucks I&#8217;m not going to be having that many picnics to get past the awful colors.</review><review> "The quilt is definitely light weight, which is what we were aiming for.

The connection is really bad, constantly disconnecting at random moments for no reason at all (I was using them with my laptop while doing a course), the material and feel of the plastic is cheap and the fitting is very secure but after 2-3 hours it becomes painful, not to mention the whole rubbery texture makes them difficult to put in and out of your ear. Overall, a terrible choice and even worse considering the price! My old &#163;30 Enacifire were waaaaay better, but if you&#8217;re looming for something of better quality and are willing to pay this much, stretch a bit more and go for the Apple AirPods or just settle for another brand like Marshall, JLB or Enacifire.Total disappointment, I&#8217;m sending them back.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQLTFZ2/ref=lp_16225009011_1_2120_twi_col_ti_2/140-5289304-2551501?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605591071&amp;sr=1-2120</link><review> \ 'I LOVE these headphones.  I was really unsure about them.  I\'m not exactly an audiophile, but I\'m definitely very fussy about what earphones I buy.  I typically user Bowers and Wilkins PX over-ear headphones and some Fidue A83 in-ear headphones.  More recently I had purchased Jarbra Elite Active 65T for workouts etc.  If I\'m listening to music, I want to hear everything, feel everything, but what can be taken for granted there is that you\'re isolating yourself from the world around you.  I went running with my wife last night and I wore the Aftershockz Aeropex and she wore her Jabra Elite Active 65T\'s.  There were some lightning flashes in the sky and the moon was an orange ball.  I was talking to her naturally, but she couldn\'t hear me - she was in her own world.  When she wanted to talk to me, she\'d almost mime, like there\'s a window between us or something.  It was very telling.  I felt free.  I could hear music and what was going on around me and that\'s wonderful.  I hadn\'t realised how much I would value that or how much the isolation of my other earphones/headphones was limiting how I wanted to use them.I think it\'s important to understand what these headphones offer.  They aren\'t perfect, they aren\'t necessarily for every situation, but I\'ve found I use them ALL THE TIME - at work, walking around the shops, using my bbq, at the gym.  I don\'t feel rude, because I\'m not isolated, I can communicate with people easily.  These are liberating.  Think of how you feel when you\'re listening to music playing from speakers vs when you\'re listening through in-ear headphones.  That\'s the experience, but the big difference is that you\'re not making anyone else listen to it with you!  It\'s as big of a game-changer as Bluetooth headphones, easily.Battery life: 10 hours battery is pretty epic.  Once you get below 20% you do get an annoying "Charge me" audio prompt every 5 mins or so.  Most truly wireless Bluetooth earbuds are in the 3-6 hours range, so these are very competitive.  The magnetic charging cable is very effective.Sound Quality:  I really like the sound quality.  You don\'t get thumping bass (more of a tap) and there are definitely some frequencies that struggle, but the overall experience is brilliant once you are used to it.  There\'s still a lot of rich detail.  Vocals and strings sound warm and rich and treble is definitely present and fairly detailed.  You get decent mids and if you turn them up you can \'feel\' the music with a bit of vibration in your cheek (tickle).  The sound stage is my favourite part.  Having your ears open really opens up the sound stage and you get an epic stereo effect.Earplugs:  The included earplugs are garbage.  If you\'re listening to music in a loud area, you won\'t be able to hear much at all.  I use Comply Earplugs (made for musicians).  They do allow some outside sounds in but reduce the volume greatly.  Aeropex has two equalizer modes (one for earplugs and one for open ears).  When you switch to the right EQ, there\'s actually a lot of detail there and they once again sound pretty decent - still a little warm, but decent.Sound Leakage:  I have tested around several people and nobody has been able to hear what I\'m listening too.Comfort: When I run, I don\'t hear the thump of my footsteps as I did with in-ear headphones.  They are light and waterproof, so you can wear them anywhere.  Doesn\'t matter if you sweat or get wet (I\'ve worn them in the shower).  You might find that you need to re-adjust them now and again.  I find the sound is richest when they\'re closer to my tragus (I had to google that too).  They don\'t move too much, even when you run.Bluetooth connection: Better than Elite Active 65T.  I found with those, that the signal passing through my body meant it dropped (think phone in pocket).  I haven\'t had any connection issues with these.In summary, if you have an open mind and love to listen to music and podcasts, I cannot recommend these enough.  If you ride a bike or run, this is a clear no-brainer.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-5-Port-Gigabit-Ethernet-Unmanaged/dp/B07S98YLHM/ref=lp_16225009011_1_215/134-0716852-3807749?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605590418&amp;sr=1-215</link><review> \ "WORST SUPPORT EVER!!!

I called the support #...sat on hold for 20+ minutes and was then politely told that my call was routed wrong.  Sat on hold for another 20+ minutes...went through all of the confirmation crap again...only to find out that I was talking to the 'WRONG DEPARTMENT' and it was out of her 'SCOPE'!!!  I pleaded with her that all I needed was the RMA #...again...out of her 'SCOPE'.  SO....I AM NOW ON HOLD FOR OVER ANOTHER 20 MINUTES...AND NOTHING.

However, if you have defective hardware beyond the 90 day window (as has happened to me), then you will effectively be unable to RMA the device without purchasing extended support. This network switch was purchased to manage my home network, and after 5 months, it has stopped functioning. The lights still work but the device itself does not, and the support tech told me "the hardware warranty only covers the physical appearance" of the device.I would avoid this product and brand. The product did not last and the "support" was an exercise in frustration. As the head of an IT group, I will not be investing company dollars into faulty hardware and run-around customer service. There are other brands out there and I suggest you look elsewhere.</review><review> "No fuss just plug it in give it some network and your off with no worries of running out of ports. Very good investment for a growing wired connection. I was getting tired of computers losing WiFi and non-wifi devices taking up all my ports.

I put this on and removed everything from my Asus and now everything is working great.Update - Out of the blue it's turned off and won't turn back on, 6 months after purchase.", "Bought this switch to replace an aging 24 port 10/100 3Com switch I've had for more than ten years. It still works flawlessly, but I need a faster switch now.Upon installation, I moved all connections from the old switch to this Netgear. No Internet. Activity lights showed traffic, but DHCP from my router wouldn't hand out an IP address through this switch.I moved all the connections back to the 3Com, and everything worked fine again. I moved connections back to the Netgear one at a time, and  it worked until I had connected 5 devices and then it would stop passing traffic.I tried different combinations to see if one particular device / circuit was the culprit, but I could not get consistent results. Besides - everything worked together all at the same time on the 3Com. Interestingly, if I loaded up only the odd-numbered ports on the Netgear, it would work fine for everything connected. Put everything on even numbered ports only, and no traffic after adding 3 or 4 devices.I called Netgear support to see if there was anything I could do to fix the problem, and I was on the phone from 2:12 pm until 4:30 pm, and ended up talking to 5 (five) reps who kept forwarding me to another rep because they each said that they were not in the right department to support this switch. I know spending over two hours to get to the right department for support for an unmanaged switch is ludicrous, but I wanted to see how far the Netgear rabbit hole would go before I was connected to a technician who knew anything at all.I finally got connected to someone who was in the right department, but after some troubleshooting (which I had already done myself prior to calling) it was determined that the switch was faulty.I packed up the Netgear switch, returned it, and purchased a Cisco instead. That switch works perfectly.Based on this customer service experience, I will never, ever buy another piece of Netgear equipment. Plus, after 90 days they want you to start PAYING for their time? Cisco provides a full year of complimentary tech support, not that you should need it for an unmanaged switch, but they are pros, and have provided excellent customer service any time I've ever needed it in the last twenty years.Do yourself a favor and do some web searching to find yourself a good switch from a manufacturer that actually provides good customer service if and when it's needed.Netgear has lost my business forever. Pity, since some of their gear is actually pretty good (when it works). Too bad a single faulty device ruined it. A bad device I can tolerate - nothing is perfect. But once I found out how inept Netgear's customer service is, I just can't continue to buy their equipment or recommend them to anyone.", 'Wanted to have a wired connection to my internet provider\'s modem for all of my main hardware, and this does the job. Have a 50ft Cat6 ethernet cable running from my modem to this switch and it provides the perfect "unmanaged" solution for a connection to my desktop, Xbox and Plex PC (all located on a lower floor and beside one another).I have 300mbps up and 10mbps down speeds, and this switch\'s caps are nowhere near that, so I\'m getting full bandwidth of my internet speeds.TLDR: For those of you that want to expand your ethernet ports and don\'t care to mess with technical settings, this is the ethernet switch/expander for you.</review><review> "Our Family recently bought a new house that was setup with Ethernet wiring throughout.  I also installed some IP Security cameras and needed a decent Gigabit Ethernet switch to connect to my Cable Modem/Router that only had 4 ports.  The 24 Port is more than what I will need and the Netgear switch fits that requirement.  The switch is rack mountable and includes the necessary brackets and hardware.  I have mine shelf mounted and used the included self-adhesive rubber feet instead.So far there are no problems with speed and the device works well with my existing 5 port D-Link DIR-655 Gigabit Router turned Switch.  Build quality is excellent and the construction is all metal.  It feels like some of the business grade routers I deal with in the Office.  The unit is passively cooled and not having a fan helps keep the noise in the network room downstairs quiet.This is a great and more than capable solution for those only looking for extra ethernet ports and don't need any switch management.", "From a performance, reliability, construction aspect, this is a no-brainer. I've had a number of these and they're sturdy metal workhorses. I'm not worried about this thing flaking out on me anytime soon.My only words of caution, or at least notes, is that the power plugs in on the opposite side from the ports. If this is somewhere you're going to be accessing/changing the config a lot, that may be preferable! But I found it a bit annoying for my setup, where I am just leaving it all plugged in for the most part, and there's stuff now sticking out of both sides, limiting the cleanliness of my setup and mounting options.Also the status lights are on each of the ethernet jacks, so here again if you want to see what's going on you have to position this with the ethernet cables facing you, which can be pretty messy. Vs other switches which have all the ports on the back, but the status lights up front.", "For this price, with this many ports it's unbeatable. Was looking for a managed POE switch and needed one in the short term. Plug and play switch, works great. I really like the metal casing and build quality. The ethernet ports on the front are very sturdy, and the light indicators make it easy to see what's connected at a glance.Speed testing shows little to no impact on network speeds, even with all 16 ports in use. I highly recommend this model if you have a simple flat network where you only need one VLAN.Just be sure to register this on the netgear website!"</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Heath-Zenith-SL-5407-BZ-B-Replacement-Selectable/dp/B00002N7FQ/ref=lp_16225009011_1_9466/137-3078754-2193113?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605593643&amp;sr=1-9466#customerReviews</link><review> \ 'Bought this to replace an older sensor that was dying. Purchased it with the "frequently bought together" box and cover, and hooked it up to an existing outside light. To extend the distance from the light, and to make it more visually appealing, I used a flexible power tool power cable I bought at the local hardware store. I included a picture so you can better see how all the items look together.This part is in the instructions, but just in case you missed it: There are two modes, always on (like a normal light switch), or night/motion sensor (what you are buying it for). You switch modes by turning it off/on in one second. If you get confused about what mode it is in, then leave it off for 1 minute and when it turns back on it will be in night/motion sensor mode.</review><review> "I purchased this sensor to replace my old sensor that starting failing. It looked like a good deal so I purchased two and installed them. Every day and night they have worked perfect but now that we are in a rainy season I have been having problems with the sensor not turning off all night until morning. Contacted sensors tech service (800/858/8501) talked to company's tech rep. he told me that I was getting a feedback from the sensor that caused it to remain on. I asked him why does this only do it when its raining and not other times, he really didn't have an answer.The sensors model no. SL-5407-BZ  Still working with it to try and find out why it's doing this only in the rain. Did check connections of base inside and totally dry.", "I bought this SL-5407-BZ sensor to replace a defective IR sensor unit on a set of Heath/Zenith floodlights we have on the side of our house. The old IR sensor unit had 240-degree coverage and no matter how it was positioned or how low the sensitivity was adjusted, it would always turn the floodlights on whenever a car drove down the road past the house, which is well over 75-feet away through trees and brush. So, I decided to try this model with its narrower 180&#8211;degree coverage and thankfully the problem has been solved. I think having it go on and off so often probably shortened its life, so I'm hoping this new sensor will last longer since the false triggering from vehicles on the street is no longer a problem. I find the 5-minute timer position to be perfect for that side of the house. So, far I'm happy with this sensor and if it continues to hold up, I will likely buy two more spares for the other sets of flood lights we have on the house."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077MXC8SV/ref=lp_16225009011_1_4850_twi_col_ti_2/144-6833184-9086207?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592011&amp;sr=1-4850</link><review> \ 'I have a lot of these types of devices, ranging in price from $10 cheep disk readers to $80 full docking station style bays.

This dock clearly does everyrhing it is advertised as doing.</review><review> 'I purchased this product around the same time that I purchased a competitive product.  The reason that I purchased two devices with the same approximate function was I had a need to back up drives and occasionally the drives would be of the same kind, i.e. SATA to SATA, IDE to IDE, and so forth.  Neither device could accommodate two drives of the same type so I purchased a secondary USB drive adapter that I thought would function as my backup USB to disk adapter.  The other device was a big, hulking plastic monstrosity that was poorly designed and constantly bent IDE pins and quickly proved itself so frustrating that I now only use that product when I have to.  This product is now my primary and I haven\'t looked back or regretted the change once.I found this product to be elegant by comparison to the other - for instance you could see where the connector was making contact with the drive and therefore no bent pins!  No more blindly hoping your drive makes proper contact with the adapter without damaging one or the other.  Imagine!  In addition, this product\'s claim of USB 3.0?  It\'s legit.  Here is output from /var/log/messages I collected just now: "bcdUSB  3.00".  The other product?  It is not usb 3.0 despite packaging claims that it is.  When purchasing an item to act as a USB to disk adapter being able to connect to drives via USB 3.0 instead of 2.0 can make a big difference.Another win for me is the fact that this is a powered USB disk adapter.  During normal use I have the drive adapters plugged into a Raspberry Pi 4, a small single-board computer that is very low-power in comparison to modern desktops and laptops.  The extra power for the adapter is greatly appreciated because without it I could not power larger form-factor SATA drives or IDE drives and likely others.  The adapter plugged into the wall provides a nice, steady flow of power that in turn powers the drives connected to it when necessary and that keeps things working smoothly.If pressed and I had to make a complaint about this product I would say that when connected to a SATA drive the connection feels like it would be easy to pull apart by accident.  Just be careful and don\'t handle the drive while it is in use (especially a spinning platter drive for obvious reasons) and you won\'t have a problem.How much do I like this product?  Enough that I am going to purchase a second one so I no longer have to deal with the other disk adapter.  At this price the product pays for itself in time saved fixing IDE pins I would have bent with the other adapter.</review><review> 'Purchased to clone HDDs from old laptops into new SSDs.

I have tried many, many, "sensitive skin" type cleansers to replace it with, and none have worked so far, and my condition has gotten quite a bit worse. Often what will happen is a cleanser will seem to work ok, for a time or two after I begin using it, and then my skin will become irritated by it, and it is on to the next cleanser.  This particular cleanser (Ultra Gentle Hydrating) however, was bad enough that after the first use my skin was quite irritated, and burned and turned bright red. To Neutrogena:  I realize the chances of you bringing back the old Extra Gentle cleanser are slim to none(although it would be great!). However, how about when creating a new cleanser that you label as being made for "very sensitive skin" that you make it the right way by testing it on a group of those of us who have very sensitive/intolerant skin like mine first?  That way you can tinker with the ingredients as needed and ensure you are putting out a quality product that is what you say it is.  I think very few of the skincare companies that make "sensitive skin" line products actually do it the right way like this. They just put together a list of ingredients that seem to them to be ok, and release their product. This seems to be the case with this cleanser which, in my mind, is a poor product, and was not tolerated well at all on my very sensitive skin.</review><review> "So ultra gentle that it doesn't remove makeup at all.Wet face, pumped cleanser on hands, rubbed into my face thoroughly, rinsed face, grabbed towel to dry off...

After being sucked into the internet black hole of conflicting skincare bs, I had high hopes for this cleanser after it was recommended for dry sensitive skin by the product selection tool on FryFace, a no nonsense dermatologist run website that advocates for simple skincare with few and proven ingredients.I guess it turns out that sometimes a lady needs some extra bells and whistles (i.e. hyaluronic acid) in her products after all.I can say that while it was so drying I had to temporarily stop my finacea  and retinol, that had both done wonders for my rosacea up until that point, it didn&#8217;t cause any additional redness or stinging, so there&#8217;s that.Back on my $25/bottle cleanser.</review><review> 'I thought I would give this a try for something different.

Bad idea. The shampoo and conditioner expired 15 months ago! On top of that it didnt smell or feel like the real deal and wasnt sealed just like previous reviews stated.

It was already damaged from years of bleaching. My stylist told me about Bed Head Resurrection, so I bought the set in the salon when it was on sale. It was amazing and the next time I went to have my hair cut, she said it was healthier than it had ever been. Sadly, they didn't have a sale so I looked for the product on Amazon and found it here and have been purchasing ever since.

Mane &amp; Tail makes my hair grow like no other product, but it&#8217;s never felt luxurious. I&#8217;ve been using this for a month and have noticed a big difference in my hair&#8217;s appearance. My hair looks and feels thicker, is shinier, and has continued to grow rapidly. My hair looks salon-treated every day. The only reason I gave 4 stars is the smell. It&#8217;s definitely pleasant, but it smells too candy-like for my taste. If I could get the same product with a more natural scent, I&#8217;d gave 5 stars all the way. I&#8217;m interested to see how my hair responds to regular use over a few months&#8217; time, because my hair gets used to most shampoos, causing it to be weighed down and meaning I have to keep a regular rotation. I&#8217;ll update when I finish the bottle.</review><review> 'This shampoo and conditioner set seems pretty good. I dont know if I would say great, exactly, but its darn good. The smell is light and nonrevolting. Both products rinsed easily. My hair was easier to comb just after washing and bouncy after drying, so I think its a win. I would most likely order it again.I noticed another reviewer for either this set or the level 2  set mention it was headache approved and I want to second that. I get headaches that make me vomit and this set did not exacerbate the issue when I showered. Showering ALWAYS helps my head feel better, even if only whilst actually in the water, but some shampoo smells are evil when you are in pain and then the shower isnt much help. This set didnt even make me gag. In that regard I give it a five!!!</review><review> 'I really wanted to love this product after reading such amazing reviews, however it has not changed the condition of my hair one little bit and has only made it really greasy, requiring me to use dry shampoo every time I use this product. I&#8217;ve even tried just using the conditioner on the very ends of my hair, but it&#8217;s still unbelievably greasy at the roots, so it&#8217;s the clearly the shampoo that&#8217;s the problem as well.

I picked this power supply because it said something about PWM fan that is on demand and quieter. Worked great until a few days later that fan got kicked up to high and then it started making a clicking noise. I opened the computer, checked all my wires and fans, but it was the fan inside this power supply. Must've got a bad one. No worries, ordered a direct replacement. Amazon and seller quickly supplied me with #2. 2 days later, high speed loud and obvious clicking that sent my son back to get me again. At this point, I spent a little more for av EVGA 650W unit, which I just finished installing, the third time I have installed and wired this computer's power supply.

It turns out that you really need to push the power cord connector as hard as you can into the power supply. The metal contact is about 70% in the socket, so if you only plug it in normally, there is no metal-metal contact. The connectors are a little painful to plug into the motherboard. You also have to jam them in very hard since some of the contacts for the plugs are not at the same position. The power cable for SATA should also have the connectors pointing at different sides so that it does not need to be extremely and roughly twisted just to get them into the SATA devices. It took a while for me to figure out why I was not getting any power to the motherboard, but eventually after examining every component of the power supply, I figured out that I wasn't jamming the cables hard enough to get some contact.", 'Llevo utilizando la fuente aproximadamente 2 semanas desde que arm&#233; mi primera PC, fue algo que quer&#237;a hacer desde hace tiempo y pens&#233;: &#191;por qu&#233; no?.

I got the grey color, and I'm very happy with that.  It looks great on my marble topped desk.  It's just as pictured.  The packaging was a little damaged right on the gel pad part, so it seems the gel pad got a little deformed on one side.  I can't feel it on my wrist, so it's just a visual issue, and really not that offensive, so I don't mind living with it.  I'm assuming it will be less noticeable as time goes on.  The pad is a little smaller than my old mousepad, but I knew that because I measured it before I ordered.  I don't mind the smaller footprint, and I don't think it will affect my use.  It's enough space to roll my mouse on.  The gel wrist support might take a little time to get used to.  It's pretty firm, so I feel a bit of pressure against my wrist when using.  Better posture and arm positioning helps that.  It took me a few minutes to get the clear film on the underside pulled off, but not that it's off, the pad really stays put.  Very happy with that.  Some people complained about the edges, so I took a close up shot of the left side.  You do see a little bit of the black base, and yes, maybe the fabric on top doesn't fully cover it, but I'm ok with that as long as it doesn't t start to peel off.  Other people said the fabric looked cheap.  I don't agree. Overall, for less than $7 I really can't complain!  This is definitely worth the price.

It's a little big for me, but I knew that from the size they put in the description. I wouldn't say that's a reason not to purchase it though. My wrist rests comfortably on the padding and my mouse works significantly better with the pad. For the price and free shipping, I highly recommend this product! They even included a nice postcard thanking me for my purchase and that they hope I'm pleased with both the product and service I received and I most definitely am! I love a nice touch such as this as it makes me feel like I've ordered from a company who really cares about their products and customers.

I have had this pad so long I would have to look up the date but I am guessing about a year. About two weeks after getting it I had dropped it off the side of my bed then stepped on it. This causes the silicon bottom layer to split. Even with the split it works fine. As a matter of fact, I am using it right now! I love it.

The gel-padded wrist rest was soft and comfortable, and the mousepad is the perfect size for an office desk. I used this mousepad in my office on a regular basis.  I liked this mousepad a lot until recently when the gel-padded wrist rest seemed to have bust (see picture with bubble on wrist rest where started to leak and dark area on wrist rest, which is the leakage seeping through the wrist rest). The mousepad has only been subject to ordinary use in the office, so I was surprised when the gel pad started leaking. The leakage now gets all over my wrist and hand when using the mousepad, and it is sticky. I will be throwing away this mousepad and purchasing a different kind.

Tried numerous other "universal" remotes to control our Shields, TVs and soundbars -- everything from Harmony to Caavo to various no-names and had finally settled on the Sofabaton U1, which although were far from perfect were also pretty decent for a standalone remote that didn\'t require a dongle or hub or whatever. But they were big and clunky with far more buttons than we actually need. When these actual Nvidia remotes finally came back in stock (in a bit of an obscure listing, I must say, but direct from Amazon, so...) I decided to order a pair and see how well they worked. Long story short, we\'re thrilled. Small, compact, no external attachments or hubs needed, and absolutely perfect control of everything we need with nothing we don\'t. If I could make two improvements, it would be getting rid of the Netflix button (man, I hate those on remotes!) and a dedicated mute button, which seems a glaring oversight. That said, the menu button in the top right corner can be configured to control up to three different actions, so I just set one of them to mute the volume. Very little would make me happier with this purchase.</review><review> "Loved the original remote that came with my 2019 shield, BUT THIS ONE IS BETTER.  The original remote was the same model, but suffered from a serious design flaw where-in the battery cover quickly became loose and would fall of constantly.  I bought this remote just to replace the original and mitigate the issue for a while.  To my surprise and absolute delight, they made a revision to the original model and added a locking latch to the battery cover!  Greatest remote ever now.  Super happy with my purchase.P.S. This will be the most well packaged tv remote you'll probably ever see.", "I've had an nVidia Shield Pro for a few years now. The device or the remote started becoming very balky. The commands would not actuate or would come in groups after trying to get the buttons to work. I ordered this one with great hopes.Unboxing and pairing were quick and painless and, so far, the commands take place instantly. Only thing that doesn't seem to work for me is the Netflix button but I don't use the Shield for our Netflix subscription anyway.I also like the triangular shape as well as the dedicated volume up/down and the menu button which lets me switch between HDMI inputs for my TIVO service and DVD player.A nice improvement over the original remote.", "I own the first generation NVIDIA Shield, and while the original remote is okay, this version fixes every annoyance I had with the original:1. I would constantly lose the original remote, partially because of how slim it is. This version is thicker, and more importantly, has a feature that allows you to play a noise on the remote in order to find it.2. The original remote would have a fairly long delay (~2 seconds) when you first pressed a button until it registered on the Shield. This is fixed in this version because it includes an accelerometer that detects when you pick it up, so by the time you press a button, it is connected and typically responds instantly.3. A problem I didn't even realize I had - this new remote allows me to stop using my bulky, ugly TV remote altogether. I really only use my Shield to watch things, and this remote has IR support which allows me to control the volume and power on my TV with ease.A couple extra things I like about it:Extra buttons, but not *too* many. There is a menu button in the top right of the remote that you can customize, for example, open Hulu if I press it once, open settings if I press twice, and a third option if I hold the button down. Very nice level of customizability, my small gripe is that the Netflix button doesn't seem to be customizable, and I'm not a fan of branded buttons. Not that big of a deal though.Finally, just looking at a picture of it, it doesn't look comfortable to hold in my opinion, but I was pleasantly surprised by the aesthetics and comfort of using it. Don't let the shape put you off, it's a great device, and well worth the money.", 'The remote comes with a small "instruction" pamphlet that shows plugging in the Shield TV then has a url to get a one page instruction on pairing the remote. Why they couldn\'t have included this in the same font size as the safety booklet, I don\'t know, but it didn\'t pair until I actually unplugged the shield TV. When I came back up, holding select seemed to do nothing again holding for maybe a minute then I pressed the power button and it turned off!  It worked! I don\'t know what I did but I finally got it! On the initial try, I had followed the instructions to hold the select close to the device and nothing happened. I went into accessories and tried to add it, but after about 2 minutes of holding select, had given up. I assumed it was DOA so had even given it just one star.It worked great after that. I would give it more stars, but the trouble to get it setup and my continued failed attempts to open the battery compartment (and I\'m not a weak guy) have me taking it down to 3 stars.</review><review> 'I love this remote compare to the older version. Its super easy to use and replacing the battery is simple and now it uses 2AAA battery. Volume control is very nice. Some reviews i read complain about the shape of the remote when laying it flat but the design of it is to be actually standing up. Bottom line is this thing is great so I purchased a second one for my other shield.</review><review> "I replaced my older 2017 remote and I'm really happy with the new remote. It's much better in every way. HOWEVER, the reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's lacking some of the functionality that it supposedly supports, i.e. changing TV menu.Some TVs - like the one I have from Hisense - don't automatically select the input until you press OK. Now I can bring up the input menu using the shield remote, and I can cycle through the input menu, BUT there's no way I can press ok to select the required input from the shield remote. I have to do that from my original TV remote.I contacted Nvidia regarding that and they might consider adding this feature in a future update, so fingers crossed. Until then, I'm not sure who to blame, but since Nvidia was able to implement such a feature, I guess they should have thought of the possible limitations.", 'After getting the 2017 Nvidia Shield I quickly realized that the stock remote was terrible. The battery had to be changed constantly. The volume control was a disaster and there was no backlight. I had been using a 3rd party remote that required a dongle that was using up a spot on my USB hub that could have been utilized by a drive.That 3rd party remote worked fine aside from voice. It drained batteries at a steady rate but nowhere near what the stock remote did.The 2019 remote compared to my previous options is perfection. Backlit keys. Real volume control buttons. The voice control works flawlessly. I have added a 3rd party silicone cover that fits perfectly. Once I remap the dedicated Netflix button to Plex a great remote will be a perfect remote.Recommended.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/MOUNTUP-Tilting-Bracket-Screen-Profile/dp/B07ZSDND57/ref=lp_16225009011_1_2773/137-3839759-0545234?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605591293&amp;sr=1-2773</link><review> \ 'Great item comes with everything you need to hang your TV all the hardware you need took like 20 minutes to complete by my 16 year old granddaughter thanks for supplying a great hanger</review><review> "We have an older Vizio TV we wanted to mount in the bedroom but we hadn't gotten the wall mount for it when we bought it.

No more paper rolls or running out of paper during a transaction, no more chasing down a pen for customers to sign the receipt, no more worrying about missing a tip or doing batching/settlement at the end of day, and no more keeping rolls of receipts for potential customer dispute/charge back (by the way the ink on receipt fades after a week anyway, you won\'t be able to read anything after that so keeping receipts is completely useless). Prior to Square I used Central Payment, they charged an all in fee around 2.78% (including statement fee, PCI compliant fee, anti fraud fee, and a host of other funny fees...). Then I switched to Elavon, which is promoted by Costco, the rate was pretty much the same around 2.75% for everything. So frustrated, I decided to do my own research instead of trying something new every time a credit card rep stops by my place to pitch "a lower/better rate".Not only Square tackled all of those problems listed above, it has the capabilities to do full and other comprehensive POS tasks such as time card m/c for employees, menu design items with picture eliminating countless hours of monkeying around trying to code or program old clunky POS systems such as Sharp POS...just to name a few!One more critical thing, Square can handle transactions without Internet for up to 72 hrs, after that simply connect it to any Wifi and it will sync &amp; batch all deposits automatically. It is simply not the case with all other terminals if your Internet is sporadic or unstable or lack bandwidth.

Since I am used to either having a very protective wallet style case or a more substantial kickstand case, I asked my husband who is an engineer to assess the case and vulnerability of the phone if dropped.  His assessment is that there is enough of a raised bezel around the screen that it should protect it unless dropped on a uneven jagged surface such as a rock.  I don't plan on doing any drop tests to check it out.Pros:  Clear Transparency  Very sleek design adding little bulk.  Easy to get on and off device.  Location of Kickstand is nice not  interfering with use of device.  Kickstand balances the camera bump so  as to limit any wobble.  Cutouts are very well done.  Nice Lip around camera bump for  protection.Cons:  I still am a bit concerned about the  sturdiness of the case.  Would prefer better protection of  screen for this expensive device.

Way too many issues. The most prominent for me are as follows1. The keyboard IS ABSOLUTE CRAP. - The connection constantly cuts in and out. (Yes I have replaced the batteries) Creates an absurd amount of typos. I will be mid sentence and it cuts out. Sometimes it\'ll pick the connection right back up, sometimes i have to smash buttons until it recognizes that I\'m trying to use it.2. Multiple buttons on the keyboard stick. (I use this for my office. It\'s not some man cave living room surrounded by drinks and food. Nothing has gotten into the keyboard. It came with sticking buttons. For example, if the keyboard gets bumped, the "1" key goes crazy 1111111111111111111111111111111  (as such)3. The mouse was absolutely tiny. Feels like it was made for a 110 year old.  (&lt;-- supposed to read 10 but due to the sticking 1 key that happens cntantly. (&lt;-- that as ell)The only reason I didn\'t return it was because I thought I could adapt and didn\'t want to go back to a corded keyboard and mouse.  HUGE REGRET. Buying a new one  now. This is a TERRIBLE product.</review><review> 'See update below.This keyboard and mouse are the quietest I have ever used. Pretty cool!The keys on the keyboard are sensitive and need only a light touch. The keys are spaced perfectly for easy typing and 10-key entry.Scrolling with the mouse is awkward. Sometimes, the page doesn\'t scroll at all; other times, it scrolls up when rolling the scroll wheel down and down when scrolling up. In trying to solve the problem, I put the dongle on the same level  and within 18" of the mouse and still have the issues. I don\'t know what that\'s about, but for the price, I can live with it.Updated - I returned this product since the mouse scrolling problem got progressively worse, even with new batteries. The keyboard started skipping letters and the 10-key pad would add numbers. Not a good thing, especially when accuracy is vital.</review><review> 'I bought the AmazonBasics wireless keyboard and mouse a couple of years ago, and I\'ve been using it every day at the office. It\'s okay.  Because of that, I ordered another one for home use in Nov 2018.  The new one is awful.  No feedback on the scroll wheel on the mouse, the key are much "mushier", and keystrokes are often not recognized, especially the space bar.  I used it for about 30 minutes and I can\'t use it anymore, it\'s so bad.  At $21, it\'s really not even worth going through the trouble to return.  I think maybe they changed manufacturers from the one they produced a couple of years ago.  Two stars because it actually is a keyboard and a mouse, and it works wirelessly.</review><review> 'This keyboard arrived missing one the flip out stands(not a huge deal if it worked). The keyboard was working initially without any issues. This keyboard quickly started failing. Keystrokes were not registering. Random keystrokes are being sent to the application in focus. I have tried swapping out batteries and cleaning the contacts with no success. I will see if Amazon stands behind their product and update this review accordingly.</review><review> "Seems good so far. Keys seem nice and quiet for typing on, which is nice when you have to type for most of an 8 hour day. The clicker on the mouse is extremely quiet to the point I don't even hear it when I click it. Might sound weird but when you have a mouse that is noisy it can also get a bit frustrating after an 8-hour day so this mouse is quite enjoyable. Only suggestion would be to have perhaps a few extra gripper pads as some desk services allow the keyboard the shift but overall pleased with the purchase so far.", 'Uno de cada 30 a 50 teclas que se presionan no las detecta el teclado. Es terriblemente molesto. Despu&#233;s de unas semanas de usarlo decid&#237; reemplazarlo por otro teclado. Me di cuenta que la falla es probablemente interferencia en la transmisi&#243;n inal&#225;mbrica ya que el problema es peor cuando activo el bluetooth de mi laptop, a pesar de que el receptor del teclado est&#225; a menos de 1 metro del teclado. No lo recomiendo.La construcci&#243;n es adecuada. Las teclas se sienten bien, tienen un toque suave y bastante silencioso.</review><review> "I was going to give this 5 stars, and was in the process of writing a review for this at 5-stars, though as i am writing i find it very annoying that certain keys will not register (perhaps due to bluetooth/wireless - this is a problem i have encountered with every single wireless keyboard/mouse i have ever used, hence why i personally use only wired peripherals).This keyboard was for my father, who does not have quiet the level of demand from computer items as myself, and he hasnt complained about it.  A bonus would be the very quiet action of the keys and mouse, making it nearly silent/inaudible when someone is typing on the keyboard - massively appreciate this vs. the old boxy dell keyboards that sound like someone's punching the keys.TLDR; 3-stars because i hate wireless keyboards (they are junk).

It has two certifications that are seemingly unnecessary for this type of electronic device, specifically FCC which is related to interference and the other roHS, which refers to "Restriction of Hazardous Substances". This is not the kind of product I\'d trust with protecting my devices, or that I\'d have confidence in leaving unattended for days. This is the second power bar I\'ve bought from Amazon.ca (the first being an Anker that wasn\'t a surge protector and emitted a horrible whirring sound) and the second time I\'ve received a poor-quality product. It seems that Amazon isn\'t performing any quality control of the products listed on its marketplace and I have no confidence in any of the electronics that aren\'t "brand name".As I\'m not allowed to post links to outside sites to show the electrical certifications, for future reference Google "electrical certification marks" and the first link should be to Electrical Safety Authority, which has the major certification marks.  You\'ll see that neither FCC or roHS are listed.I recently purchased (not from Amazon) an APC surge arrest power bar for less than $50 and among its features is a c MET us certification, which is an actual certification that is relevant for electronics.An aside; earlier this year, I purchased some timers for interior lights, sold on Amazon, which did not have an acceptable or legitimate certification, rather only a mark of self-certification.Please be mindful of purchasing electronics on Amazon.</review><review> "I think this is a decent bar for the desk.

Or even LED usb desktop lamps.  2.4a charger OK for phones but again this is dates since most phones demand 3a charging.  I am OK with this though because I use this PowerBar to power home hubs like all of my BLink security camera hubs. They only need 1amp.  There are better power bars out there with usb charging. But I specifically only needed 1amp and this fits the bill with the budget pricing.", 'The photo shows all 6 USBs as 2.4A. In reality 2 are and 4 are 1A.This essentially only gives me me 2 chargers for our house of 3 alduts. And 4 useless USBs. This exact one was another option for a cheaper price.

Fed up I decided to push out the screen but it is glued in and removing it is a pain and it doesn\'t break off easily leaving jagged edges on the side.  Also, outside of the case scratches very easily.As some of the other reviews have stated, this case is VERY bulky.  Holding it up to my phone still in the old case, it adds almost a 1/4" extra width all around the screen.  I needed something that really protects my phone so I decided to try it out.  But it just feels bulky in hand and it comes with a built-in screen protector that is annoying.  It has these tiny little perforations all over the screen and gives the screen that oily hazy (rainbow) look at certain angles...clean.  IT does also attract fingerprints.  It\'s a good looking case but just too bulky and they should opt to leave the screen off or make it easily removable.  You\'d have to break it off to remove it.</review><review> 'The case doesn&#8217;t fit my IPhone X it doesn&#8217;t cover the left side of the phone totally.  The silicon on the left side were the volume buttons are causes the case not to fully cover the phone.

I have not dropped it yet so I will update after a drop or two. The biggest con is the plastic screen. It is plastic so not that flimsy however, it collects dust &amp; fingerprints and diminishes the beauty of the screen. I will be attempting to remove the plastic screen and replacing it with a good screen protector.UPDATE: I was able to remove the plastic screen cover from this case completely without damaging the case. I used an exacto knife to get between the plastic and the case. Didn&#8217;t take long but precision was required.</review><review> 'I was looking for a cover that could protect the whole phone while still being visible without having to open a flap. I was attracted to this because the design looked good and it have fair reviews.First off it arrived on time in a well presented box. Unfortunately when fixing it to the phone I noticed a scratch to the plastic screen only noticeable when the phone screen is black. Undeterred I thought I would keep it on until my replacement arrived.Now this is not a cheap cover. 1 penny short of &#163;20 is quite a bit these days. The cover fitted well with the buttons accessible. It is quite bulky even though it&#8217;s described as a slim case. The bumpers on the face cover protrude quite a bit and make it quite difficult to touch anything near the edge of the screen.Now for the real problem. I took it out last night, only exposed it for 30 seconds to a light drizzle while phoning for a cab. When I got home there was water under the cover. See the attached photo. I have no idea if it&#8217;s rain or condensation from the humidity but this is a complete no-no for me and the replacement I have ordered will be going back without opening</review><review> 'Before purchasing this product, I thought it was one of the best cases I&#8217;ve seen. Therefore I decided to purchase the item. It arrived on time and had great packaging.However, there was some space in between my screen and the front bit of the case (the front case was plastic, if it was glass, it would of been better). Due to the space, it had some bubbles. I had to pressed hard in order to type which was affecting my screen. The case was slightly small on the left side so it would not cover my screen completely.If this case did not contain the front case, then it would be amazing.To be honest, it was a waste of money. Either way, the case is too expensive &#128078;&#127996;</review><review> 'After a &#163;247 bill to replace the smashed screen on my iPhone X-  I purchased this case, as &#163;20 didn&#8217;t seem too bad in comparison!Pros: looks great- I&#8217;ve had many compliments in the one day I&#8217;ve had it.Feels nice and is easy to hold, I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s too bulky as I like the added grip the case gives you and it feels very sturdy.  I havnt dropped my phone to be able to advise if it absorbs shock well (I hope I don&#8217;t need to find out!) but from the looks of it, it feels like it would do the job.Cons: the front screen protector doesn&#8217;t sit flush and leaves air bubbles which if the phone is held at certain angles can appear quite visible. The screen also has very tiny white dots from top to bottom as part of its design which I found very distracting. It&#8217;s paticularly noticeable if your brightness is on low. After a days use with 75% brightness, I have found I&#8217;m noticing it less so maybe this is something I will forget is there in time.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/FLOVEME-Compatible-iPhone-12-Pro/dp/B08K3H7J6S/ref=lp_16225009011_1_4290/139-6904387-5260723?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605591812&amp;sr=1-4290#customerReviews</link><review> \ 'I have used otterbox for 10 years, no complaint, but the price.

It fits the iPhone 12 just fine, the newer phone has a slightly smaller body so don&#8217;t worry about it.

So far one of joints that attach the band to earcups have snapped so that the earcup dangles around(another review already has a picture). I know from watching her that she isn\'t rough with them at all, which makes me feel this is a  design flaw. Its been 2 months so I\'m going to have to go to the manufacturer for warranty support. It\'s a pain, but I haven\'t had issues with corsiar in getting things serviced before. Other than that, these are my favorite gaming headset which makes it even more of a shame that this happened. Mike quality is good. Sound quality for gaming is great for the $70 .00 I spent, and footsteps/gunshots are easy to distinguish Until there are explosions, callouts, teamchat, gunfire going on at the same time. Then the sound just mushes together. Also, it kinda sucks that I can\'t use the wireless version with my Xbox one s. Positives are the cross stitching on the band, the overall non-gamer look, and how comfortable they are.Edit* 9-24-2018It took awhile but i finally got my replacement set back from corsair. They required receipts, all the parts that came in the box, original packaging, pictures of the damage, You need to pay for shipping(i\'m against paying for return shipping in situations like this, but whatevs), and provide shipping information. Once they do approve the replacement they ship it back using the slowest shipping method possible. If i could do it all over again, I would have gotten the Kingston Hyper X headset.Edit* 12/14/2019 lowering to one star.Headphones A: both Hinges broke again. Headphones B: The ear pads glue came undone and had to request ear pads from Corsair, which they sent out free of charge. Also, the battery will not charge. Will have to send both to Corsair to RMA again. At least Corsair has a 2 year warranty. &#175;\\_(&#12484;)_/&#175;12/20/2019Warranty Denied after ticket was escalated.

I\'ve had them for several weeks and they\'re pretty sturdy feeling so far. The have some heft in my hands without feeling heavy on my head.Comfort: These headphones feel great on my big head. I\'m the kind of person that gets headaches from wearing hats tight or loose. Gaming for hours at time in these hasn\'t been a problem for me. The earphones are big enough to fit completely around my ears as opposed to sitting on them. They feel a little warm sometimes, but that\'s more of a me problem. The removable microphone is also really nice.Sound: I\'m not an audiophile, but I also hate cheap, tinny sound. The audio quality is pretty decent to me. I didn\'t care for the default EQ, but I\'m pretty happy with them after making a custom profile.Surround: I personally don\'t care for it. It sounds like the "concert hall" effect on home audio receivers to me. I just leave them in stereo mode. Doesn\'t really bother me since I didn\'t buy them for the surround effect.Controls: There\'s a power button on the bottom of the right headphone. It turns them on/off with a long press. A short press is used to prevent the auto shutdown when prompted after 5 minutes (customizable) of inactivity. The left headphone has mic on/off button that works via a short press. A long press turns on/off the mic feedback. The mic feedback is nice for checking how you sound or if the mic is picking up noise from something in your environment. There\'s an analog volume dial on the rear of the left headphone that works well, but it feels like a cheap potentiometer compared to the rest of the build quality.Sound delay: There\'s no perceivable delay. That\'s something I worried about for gaming using a wireless headset.Range: The range is decent. It\'s a little frustrating because it falls just short of reaching my kitchen on the first floor. My PC is in an upstairs bedroom in a normal wood-framed structure. It would be nice to be able keep talking while I run to the kitchen for a beverage. You can\'t have it all though.Software: This is where things go south quickly. The bottom line is that the software is unacceptably slow for what it does. The functionality is great, but the delays are unbelievable. I\'m using a decent computer with a solid state drive. I can\'t comprehend what this app is doing when it takes 10 to 15 seconds for the client to come to the foreground from the system tray. That\'s when it doesn\'t crash. Oh, and they have the nerve to show ads for games in the management program. It\'s only useful for products that Corsair sells for money. What were they thinking? It\'s a shame that such a well-made product is hamstrung by terrible software. Corsair, please fix this problem! I would love to upgrade my review to 5 stars.</review><review> "Love these headphones. Great sound and the fake 7.1 actually isn't bad. I also use a HD598 and I would have to say they sound similar. The bass is heavier in the HS70s but I can live with it. I just like the convenience of no cable. Got really tired of my HD598s cable constantly getting tangled with my mouse of Keyboard. My PC is on my right and the cable from the HD598 is on the left. What really got me was the feel and quality. They have this heft to them, they are not heavy to wear but when you pick them up they have this solidness to them. My HD598s feel flimsy compared to the HS70. The SE colour style is another thing, they look like they should cost double what they really are. I still can't believe they are so cheap for a wireless headset with this level of sound and build quality.  The only 2 things I don't like are, 1) even if you have them hooked up charging, when full they will stop charging. You leave them for a day then grab them put them on, you think they would be at 100% because they have been hooked up charging for a day, nope they will be anywhere from 90% all they way down to 25%. At least that has been my experience. I get it is to protect the battery but there has to be a way for it to keep topping up the battery while connected to a charging cable. The 2nd is that to check battery level you have to open the Corsair app then click on the headset and then the advanced tab. Why not have it show in the windows taskbar?  Other than those 2 peeves it's a good headset worth the money.", "Constant static noise, awful microphone sound quality (equivalent if not worse than using your phone speaker microphone), sound quality is mediocre but not worth the money for $99, also the fit is tight/small.Overall not a good product, wouldn't recommend for anything. The sound and mic are awful, nothing good about it other than the build of the headset feel somewhat decent."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/elago-Charging-Hub-Black-AirPods/dp/B0798M9WYQ/ref=lp_16225009011_1_7247_det/131-8140421-1081153?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592850&amp;sr=1-7247#productPromotions</link><review> \ 'I love everything minimalist and am especially obsessed with cable management. I would&#8217;ve invented this product myself, if it had not been done already! I like the fact that it&#8217;s just a base for the wires, because if any of the parts break, they can just be replaced separately. For anyone who is having trouble feeding the wires through, you just need to use your nails to push the cable head into the holes. It takes a while to figure out, but totally worth it!</review><review> 'First, this isn&#8217;t a high end charger station. I offer my comments with low expectations. You bring your own cables and assemble it yourself. Still, my main issues with this are...1.) The cable hole for the phone isn&#8217;t sized to keep the charging cable in place.2.) the watch charger isn&#8217;t placed correctly to allow the watch to be placed with the Digital Crown either up or down.3.) the charger is very light. This can make pulling the phone off without also lifting the charger too a bit hard.</review><review> 'The cords are very hard to put in.

It is literally just a bit of silicone. I was really after some thing that would minimise cables which this is not. Also doesn&#8217;t fit AirPods Pro properly but again my mistake - it would be easy to adapt the design to have it fit all types of AirPod. So overall, my fault for not reading the listing properly but even that aside it&#8217;s expensive for what it is and I would say there are better options available.</review><review> 'This is the worst ever contraption to set up. It has taken me 40 minutes just to make the cables fit through the ridiculously sized holes.  A lot of swearing and crying was involved.

One of my Lorex LNE8950ABW camera was destroyed in building fire a few months ago, so I decided to give this Amcrest IP5M-T1179EW-28MM a try as it was also 60% less in cost compared to the LNE8950ABW camera.Quality:Excellent build quality, strong overall housing.I can&#8217;t believe the image quality is as good at the Lorex 8MP camera given this is a 5MP camera.Starlight sensor provides better visibility at night in color and works better than the black and white night vision. I get clearer images for faces, cars, and license plates for farther distances at night.Connection:Directly connected to my Lorex LNR616 using an ethernet cable, and it worked out of the box!You do not need a DVR or NVR for this camera to work. You can plug this camera on a POE network switch or buy a POE injector for a regular switch/router/access point to supply power, Video, and audio all over a single network cable.Access:I use the browser on my desktop to access settings. Still, you can also access this camera and setup page via local web interface over a browser, Amcrest View Pro app, Amcrest Surveillance pro, or Amcrest Cloud. The mobile app is straightforward to use, and it guides you step by step.Audio:The built-in mic is susceptible to picking up audio. I can hear the customers even outside the night window.Storage:I am currently using this camera with SDCard of 256GB with snapshots uploaded to local FTP onsite data sever, H265 compression helps keep the files 40% smaller and get more playback time. There are also other various storage options available that are handy when needed.Interface:Clean web UI and functionality, I must say more than my Lorex NVR.I am so impressed with the value received for the quality and price. I will look into, Standalone license plate capture camera (if they have one) as I am using my current lorex camera with openALPR but it is not doing a job at capturing license plates and smart home video doorbell, as the two doorbells I use at the hotel that customers have to press to receive service as my current ones keep dying every few months due to rough and frequent use by customers including direct sun heat they get 5 hrs a day.Love about this camera:This camera is capable of standalone operation. This means you do not need an NVR to make the camera work. It has a built-in NVR functionality. It can also detect motion, record video clips to a microSD card, send an email and push notifications, even upload to an FTP server.Lorex cameras cannot do any of this. Without an NVR or another device like NAS to store the video, there&#8217;s no point in buying one. Also, since they have ONVIF support, they should theoretically work with any ONVIF-compliant NVR.Overall:I would purchase a camera and would recommend anyone looking for excellent quality and functionality products for a valued price.</review><review> "Packaging:Very simple and has all the necessary parts.  Everything is packed with nice foam paddings around it.Physical Product:Plastic and metal parts are seem pretty solid. I noticed that this camera took the design cue from the IP8M-T2499E with some notable changes. I noticed that there's now a plastic ring for mounting that comes with a quick release tab. I'm not a fan of this because it makes it relatively easy to unhook and disconnect this camera. I feel that it is less secure than the T2499E's method of using a grub screw to hold it in place.The chassis that holds the camera itself is not bad, it does hold the proper amount of tension to keep the camera from rolling.I like how the microSD card &amp; reset port is behind 2 phillips screw door that has a proper rubber seal. It's a bit annoying to open up, but it's not really meant to be opened up often, so I actually like that.Video quality:Compared to the IP4M-1028E (which is the camera the T1179EW is replacing), the color is more vibrant with WDR on, BUT, and a very huge BUT: the fisheye on this camera is very pronounced. there is not fisheye correction algorithm or option, which is a shame. This is my one biggest issue. I absolutely hate the fisheye effect and wish there was a built in option to correct it.Audio:It's great to finally have audio on these cameras. The quality seems on par for a camera with a mic that is that small.App Installation:I used the older Amcrest View app to add the camera. It was simple enough as usual, which is good.WebGUI:The web based firmware is not bad, but it is missing a few options here and there compared to the older cameras. I did notice that the DDNS function here is very wonky. It took me a few attempts to get my settings to stick and I had to click back and forth to another setting before it finally showed me the correct setting.General Notes:I think that this is not a bad camera in general, but compared to the IP4M-1028E that I replaced it with, I feel that this camera only had 3 things that is better:1) Slight better colors2) H.265 encoding3) AudioOn the other hand, I feel that this camera loses out on several things:1) the fisheye effect is really bad. it makes the images look stunted and compressed.2) The camera sacrificed a lot of security in favor of quick installation. A camera that is meant for outside use, should not be able to be removed by simply pressing down 1 very visible tab and pushing away from it. It should have been way more secure than this.While there were less cons than pros, I do take it as a huge con in regards to visual quality and physical product's security. I believe that any outdoor camera should always be built with the thought that it will receive a lot of abuse from the elements. The material itself, I think will definitely hold, but the method of installation is what worries me because the only way this camera will not have issues in terms of pest entry and such is that I have to pair it with a junction box, otherwise, this camera leaves a hole where the ethernet cable comes through. This is the same issue I had with your other camera the IP8M-T2499EW.I will probably still keep this camera where it is currently because it does still work decently and it sits high enough that it's quite a hassle to remove or to get tampered with. I did have to spend extra money to accommodate for the design flaw by getting a junction box, which I'm not much of a fan of, but that's about it.", 'The camera is great, easy to install and provides a great picture feed. Overall quality is good. Mobile app to view the feed / configure Camera is however horrendous and on that basis alone would make me reconsider purchasing another Amcrest camera again'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Bushnell-Engage-Hunting-Laser-Rangefinder_LE1700SBL/dp/B07T86F7D9/ref=lp_16225009011_1_4783_m/134-9050491-5242705?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605591985&amp;sr=1-4783</link><review> \ 'This review is on the Bushnell ENGAGE LE1300SBL Laser Rangefinder, which is the NEW version - mine was made in May 2019.  If you look elsewhere, or for reviews, you will probably find the Bushnell PRIME LP1300SBL 1300 Laser Rangefinder --which is the older model.  I did not find many differences..The optics appear as they claim to my eyes: very bright and very sharp.  The LCD information screen is typical: under most situations readable and fine, but in shadowed areas a little hard to see--but usable..The accuracy is significantly better than my 4 YO  Leupold TBR Laser Rangefinder (expensive), but that may be to better technology.  This rangefinder gives you consistently accurate readings while in the ARC Mode (angle range compensation), which is on the LCD screen just below the line of sight distance, out to the 40 yards I have verified (that I know the angular distance from Stands and the line-of-sight distance.  I also checked it against measured targets at 15 yards, 25 yards, 30 yards, 40 yards, 220 yards, and 470 yards (that have been ranged by multiple devices and different people).  This range finder was dead on, and never misread the distance as long as the "bulls eye" or "brush" setting was correct--very nice job here.  I assume that it will work great out to their "claimed" 600 yards for deer (See Picture Diagram)..It is all black, but dull, excepting the 2 front lenses--I added camo the wrap to the front. It is smaller than other rangefinders I have used, but fits comfortably in your hand--nice job with that.  It had only 2 buttons, so once it is setup, it\'s fast to use..However, setting it up is an issue.  Ditto with the "instructions.".The only usable instructions were how to attach the lanyard, and the FTC statement.  There was NO user manual.  The 2 pages of paper had only this information in several languages.  The small "user" card was basically an advertisement of features.  This must be a sick joke . . ..I found a Bushnell manual online for the older model  (Bushnell Prime LP1300SBL) and was able to put together enough information to set up the menus.  This PDF Bushnell manual is confusing; poorly organized; and, had images / captions in poor relationships.  They really need to have a Technical Writer overhaul their manuals and put some emphasis on "logical and clarity". . . ..The 2 PRIMARY settings you\'ll need to adjust are marked with the Red and Green Boxes in my Picture..If you can manage to get these settings the way you want them, you\'ll be good to go for most bow hunting and rifle-hunting situations:.Angle Range Compensation Modes :  &#8226; Bow Mode &#8226; Rifle Mode.Targeting Modes:  &#8226; BullsEye Mode  &#8226; Brush Mode.Overall, this was a good purchase.  I looked at all of the Rangefinders under $200 (including the Vortex Optics Impact 850--and I really like Vortex optics), and I think I made a good choice.  The Optics and Technology is there in this Newer Bushnell Rangefinder, but user-friendly instruction is sorely missing. . .

The first time in April 2018.  I used it once a week and it lasted two months.  The motor became louder and louder, and it seemed to overheat while using it so I oiled the blades and continued using it. All of sudden it started smoking and the motor froze up.  I purchased it again in July 2018 thinking maybe I just got a lemon the first time.  The second one broke after using it twice.  The bottom cutting blade flew out while using it. Pretty dangerous actually.  I tried repeatedly to fix the item myself, but the blade kept flying off.I spent the extra money thinking this pair of clippers would likely cut better and last longer. I&#8217;ve had clippers I paid $19 last two years. I definitely don&#8217;t recommend this product.</review><review> "After nearly a decade of replacing cheaper clipper sets every 2-3 years I finally decided to purchase a more expensive set.  I'm glad I did!  Even if they only last as long as cheaper ones, there's a handful of things I'm happy to pay the higher price for.If it matters, I cut my own hair, and have for as long as I can remember, so my feedback is from that context.  I don't cut anyone else's hair, and I tend to cut more frequently (every 5-6 days) so that I only need minor touch-ups vs. having to commit to an entire cut.Here's what I like about these vs. cheaper sets I've used in the past:1.  Better/stronger motor.  Part of why I replaced cheaper sets so often is b/c they'd eventually start pulling my hair, regardless of proper blade oiling and sharpening.  I immediately felt a difference in how much smoother these cut, especially during faster movements.2.  Stronger, smoother closed &amp; open guard adjustment - feels far more assured than what I'm used to on cheaper sets.  No matter how small or large the adjustment, the gaurd stays in place once adjusted.3.  Guard combs that stay in place, finally!  On cheaper Wahl clippers I always had to worry about guard combs coming off b/c that happened every so often.  The guard combs in this set snap on much firmer and have stayed in place extremely well.4.  1/2 and 1 &amp; 1/2 guards are included.  These allow more flexibility and safety when blending fades.  In my case, I'm spending much less time going back and forth between the 0, 1, and 2 gaurds - the half guards hit the mid points much better and faster.5.  Heavier feel.  I value this b/c I have large hands.  The heavier feel of these provides better guidance, especially during faster movements.I've only used these a handful of times so far but remain very impressed.  Definitely recommended.", "After watching so many youtube videos on how to cut a toddler's hair, I finally decided to buy this clipper and I love it! Very easy to use and such a good quality for the price I paid. I was scared to use it the first time of course. I was worried that I might hurt my son, but it was very safe and I got used to it right away. My son's hair turned out great. No more bowl cuts and no more overpriced hair stylist.", "Wow, the value here is insane. I got the clippers while it was on sale (still seems to be at the time of this writing) and I was genuinely not expecting them to be professional-level build quality, but then again I knew Wahl was the way to go just because I have seen them in so many barber shops. All of the accessories are nice and come in a very clean looking soft case. The clipper guards are my favorite part, there are a lot of options. The metal fasteners built into each plastic guard fells sturdy but it will flex a bit as this is how the guards are attached to the unit. The unit being corded is a HUGE advantage as far as I'm concerned. No more rushing through my beard trim before the batteries die and I have yet to have a hair snagged by the blades. It works so smoothly and the humming noise is nice if you experience ASMR (I do). I very heartily recommend these clippers to everyone.", 'Just received this today, and my review will echo a lot of previous reviews, both good, and unfortunately bad.I was impressed with how sturdy all of the attachments felt, and equally impressed with the solid feel of the unit itself.It was used for a quick trim, and did cut through the hair with ease.On this front, I was quite pleased.My only complaint and -1 star is due to the fact that I, like others, had a damaged attachment right out of the bag, of course being the much needed "1/2" piece.  As seen in the photos, one "tooth" was bent right out of the bag it came in, and I\'m not sure if it\'s evident in the picture, but it is BARELY hanging on.  Have others had good success in getting this piece replaced?Other than that, so far I\'m impressed with the product.</review><review> "These clippers are the real McCoy.

I use a flat sheet on top of my down comforter to catch the dog fur but it&#8217;s also holding up like steel!  Excellent top/flat sheets.  Buy them!  Update #2 - these get a little less wrinkles with each washing.  I do like them very much.  Update:  after laundering these three times I had to leave an update.

My husband appreciates how much less they cost than my 1,000 TC cotton sheets which I&#8217;ve been using for about 16 years.  It&#8217;s a big switch for me.

I really wish this was mentioned somewhere in the description or instructions.  Beware the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra COME WITH A SCREEN PROTECTOR INSTALLED. When you peel off the plastic with the tan, it leaves behind a very thin and discreet screen protector.  This makes for adhering issues with anything you put on top. I put on the armor suit and noticed the edges peeling up and weird rainbow effects.  I left it on for a bit to ride in my pocket and when I peeled it off to trash it thinking it was garbage, I noticed the factory applied screen protector.

If you can follow the directions and ignore the constant low toner alarms -- after you just put new toner in, then this is a great option for you. Taking the chips off the original cartridges was a bit fussy and I had a bit of trouble keeping them in place while I loaded them into the printer, but that being said I have not had any issues with them since.  I'm glad I know that I can just replace the toner for a reasonable price and don't need to buy a new printer's worth of name brand ink. I will definitely be buying more toner from True Image.Update: July of 2020: The toner is Still performing well. My wife ran cardstock through the printer and was thrilled how it came out. She told me that she didn't even use all of my toner since it said low toner before and after her project... little did she know that the toner read as low when I put the new cartridges in. All in all, I am still extremely satisfied with this toner.", "Finally a product that performs as stated. I cringed at the thought of having to buy OEM toner and went against my better judment in purchasing after market toner. but the cost of OEM was almost the cost of the device. Enter True Image Toners. I was skeptical for sure but now I am glad I made the choice.tye instructions were clear one how to transfer the chip from my old OEM toner and place it on these. came with nice tweezer to make even simpler. put the toners in, the printer did it's thing and viola it was ready. on the first teat print it was very apparent that these are going to perform well. great color and saturation. I nor my wife could see any anomalies in the prints. Thank you True Image for actually selling product that is true to it's claims. FYI this color laser printer is used for our business and the printout are used for marketing mailers. We will be buying more of this particular brand and supplier.Thank You,J", 'Took a chance on these cartridges to save $300 and they print really well, just like the originals. It did take a little work to transfer the chip, and sometimes it still says toner is low, but it doesn&#8217;t prevent the printer from printing. Worst case, you just keep printing until you get some off colors and then you know to swap them out again. Would much rather do that than pay $400+ for the HP ones, that&#8217;s a complete ripoff. So I say go for it, they show you how to transfer the chip, they&#8217;re not hiding the ball on that part. So if you want to save money and still print great docs and images, these are the printer cartridges you&#8217;ve been looking for.</review><review> "Transferring the chips from the old HP toner to the new cartridges was super easy.  They even provided a pair of tweezers and a clipper to help out.  You literally just take them from one cartridge and put them in the other.  Anyone can do this.  Once the I booted everything back up the printer worked perfectly.  The documents I've done so far look just like the ones I printed out with the HP toner.  I will definitely buy these again", "I purchased from this company for the cost savings. Ink cartridge prices for name brands have gone through the roof. My husband and son did the installation for this and had no problems after watching the video. It's been working great ever since and at a fraction of the cost!!! I would have given it 5 stars for easy to install, but you do have to make the effort to pay attention while watching the video.", "My cartridge has a microchip. The installation of this chip is near to impossible on these toner cartridge due to the design.

I have been using them for over 3 years and have never had any issues with their charging cables aside from normal &#8220;wear and tear&#8221;. Unfortunately tonight I experienced a very odd and seemingly random break! I have had this cord a little over a month, ordered on Nov. 25. I have had zero issues with it, it&#8217;s been charging at lightning speed, and the cord had shown no signs of any possible issue. I plugged my phone in this evening and heard a louder &#8220;snap&#8221; than the normal sound a charger makes when it becomes snug with the phone. I instinctively pulled out the cord and was met with the picture attached :(  I in no way am trying to turn anyone away from this company, faulty things can happen to any product. I&#8217;m just disappointed this happened, and happened so soon after purchase.</review><review> "I was excited to order and receive one of the very first of Anker&#8217;s newest Apple cables, their first in Midnight green, theoretically to complement the new iPhone 11. My first impression wasn&#8217;t so excited however. Not only does the cable look more like a dark grayish green but it feels stiffer than a piece of spaghetti in a snowdrift. Seriously it is the stiffest cable I&#8217;ve ever seen.Aside from not being especially aesthetic nor user friendly how well it works becomes a moot point, it&#8217;s a cable after all and these days they either work or they don&#8217;t. This one works and it serves its purpose despite Anker&#8217;s decision to charge us a little more for it because it&#8217;s not plain white.I give them kudos for choosing to make a cable in a highly unusual color even if I was expecting something with more pizzazz but I&#8217;m not so good with how inflexible it is. Nice but not a home run.INCOMPATIBILITY REPORT the new Midnight Green cable (which is really a dark grayish green) for me has an incompatibility issue with my iPad Pro 10.5 - my device reports that it is not supported and it won&#8217;t charge.  I contacted Anker&#8217;s tech support and they were not very helpful, they told me my new iPad probably has a dirty charging port, despite me telling them that it charges perfectly with my white Anker cable and that the green cable works perfectly with my iPhone XS Max.Dealing with Anker&#8217;s technical support has really gone downhill lately.  Even though I contacted them using the seller messaging link which proved I had just bought the cable they didn&#8217;t believe me and I was required to send them either the serial number from the product or a photo of it to prove I actually had it, then they agreed to replace it but only if I would return the defective one to prove I wasn&#8217;t trying to pull something. That&#8217;s a lot of inconvenience to me for something that they messed up on.  Coincidentally I had just ordered a Belkin USB-C charger and lightning cable and it works perfectly and the cable is much more flexible.ANOTHER UPDATE the rating of this cable remains high. While dealing with Anker isn't quite as smooth as it was when they were a small company to their credit they did come through and replace my cable and no longer requested that I send the defective one back. I threw it away because I suspect there is a broken internal wire and I've heard stories about bad charging cables starting fires. I still would prefer a more flexible cable so the best I can do is four stars for this green cable.", 'I normally don&#8217;t write reviews, but since there isn&#8217;t that many on this product at the time of me writing this I will write one to show my appreciation.I have an iPhone X that I&#8217;ve used for about a year and a half. I always wanted to actually fast charge my device since I&#8217;ve gotten it, but figured using the iPad 10W charging cube was fast enough for me, as I didn&#8217;t want to spend the $80 it cost to buy the genuine Apple fast charging setup (the usb c cube, and the usb c to lighting cable).I looked for awhile on here, filitering our the knock off branded USB C to Lighting Cables, and found this Anker one for $15.A 6ft, fast charging capable, durable, and lifetime warranty cord for $15?! I bought it instantly and was happy I could find such a good deal.Upon opening, i was excited to see how thick this cord was. I&#8217;ve gone through several genuine Apple cords, only to have the cord under the Lighting Port connector fray after a couple months of use. I suspect that the thinness of the Genuine Apple cords is the culprit, and this Anker cord does not seem that it&#8217;ll have that issue at all. On top of seeming really durable, the 6ft cord was a convience I never knew I wanted (they also included a cable tie made Velcro)This cable charges my iPhone X from 5%-55% in a matter of only 30 minutes, with a full charge only taking an additional 40 minutes to get to 100%.While writing this review, I plugged my phone in with this cable at 20%. 15 minutes later, my phone is now at 50%.For reference, the power cube I am using is a  Anker PowerPort Speed PD 30.</review><review> 'I LOVE Anker products! I have had nothing but great experience with all of their products.  When outfitting our equipment at work for emergencies I always pick Anker cables because of the quality and consistency in the products.  This was my first purchase of any USB-C to Lightning using an Anker PowerPort 2 PD charging block.  The charge time on an IPhone 8+ is screaming fast! From a 2% charge to 50% took 33 minutes! Fantastic product from a reliable company! I highly recommend it!!*with the right charging block...</review><review> 'I purchased this along with an Anker USB C charger for an Iphone 8. The cable arrived and was well packaged in boxes this was then strengthened when i took the cable out of the packaging. A really great quality cable with its own velcro manager which helps keep it tidy when transporting. The cable itself feels premium and most certainly better than cables which come with some products from new. Well worth the purchase for a high quality cable.</review><review> 'I have been trying loads of cables from different companies and none of them carried on working.

I used to buy laptops a long time ago from the company now known as Lenovo but was once IBM. The computers never broke on you. Now back to the tablet. The screen is far better than any tablet I have seen. And I am a computer tech. Second the speed is good. Third the battery last for about 3 days full charge depending on use. Now I don't play games so I don't know how long that would last on a charge. But surfing and emails and playing HD videos it last a long time. I love this tablet. My wife has a Galaxy Tab 10A and it blows her tablet out of the water. From pictures to video to the screen resolution and speed it's not even close. I see now I have to buy her one because she was not happy when she seen that LOL! Any way one thing that can be done is customizations where you can do more with the tablet. It's simple and not much to change on the tablet. But besides that man this tablet is so smooth and clear my goodness. Makes looking at videos better than looking at TV and I have 4k video. But the clarity of that screen is amazing and smooth. Downloading apps from google was a breeze. I had one issue with one app and that was Experian but I just went on the browser and done it that way. I also like that google has Microsoft Edge new browser that thing takes google chrome and make it look stupid !! I never thought I would like another windows browser ever because of chrome but I lied. Google better step up because Microsoft Edge is a beast!! With that as my browser it feels like a windows computer but yet it's android. Man I am loving this tablet. You can't go wrong people. I haven't found anything to say I hate this for what I use it for. The cameras are good. I haven't taken pictures with them yet but far as how it looks and the video looks when using the camera it's great! I don't use a tablet for those things but far as I can see pictures will be very nice on that tablet that is a bonus. And you can video stream far as zoom and any other camera streaming app. It's clear and works well. If you want a tablet this one is the real deal. As far as tablets I call this the #1 Killer to all tablets out there. Benchmarks I don't get into if you looking for that  it ranks pretty decent. But I don't get into that because I don't use that to it's full potential for what I need it for. Gamers can use this but I am not a gamer. But playing games work on this tablet and works well and flawless. I have the 4gb and 64gb model. And for $199 man that's stealing !!! Well enjoy people if you buy this tablet you will love it.", 'When I  bought this tablet, I expected performance on the order of other tablets on the market, or phones, running Android.  I am disappointed to say that this device is extremely laggy.  For example, I stream a lot of content over the YouTube app.  Minimizing/maximizing the video seems to take 3 or 4 seconds for the system to process swipes to do so (something that is instantaneous on my phone, which has considerably less processing power than this tablet).  I get the impression that this device is very new to the market and I am hoping that there will be some type of update to address these issues, because, aside from the lag inherent to using some key apps, this is a great tablet.</review><review> "I bought a budget tablet 6 months ago, and was sorry almost immediately.

I have flat straight oily hair so I need a conditioner that doesn't weigh my hair down or make it oily. Traditional conditioners are made with heavy plastics and silicones which are shortcuts to actually conditioning and nourishing your hair. The conditioning agents in this conditioner are all natural and good for your hair. Without the heavy silicones, the conditioner rinses out very easily, and doesn't weigh hair down. It is so mild that you could rub a little into skin and it wouldn't make it sticky. It smells really nice too, kinda like vanilla syrup and marshmallows.  After air drying my hair, my hair feels less frizzy and puffy than when I use regular conditioners, which leave that slick unclean feeling. I will stock up on more of these. Regarding the hair lengthening aspect of the conditioner, I have not used it long enough to make any comment on that. This conditioner may work differently if not paired with the corresponding shampoo. The SHea Moisture shampoo is actually moisturising and doesn't strip hair so that the conditioner doesn't need to be as heavy. Because of that, they work best synergistically.", 'Received the conditioner yesterday and used it last night. My hair is SO mucher softer just after one use.

I\'m not a smart phone user that uses that type of device for everything.  My review is based on the musical aspects of this particular sound bar.As a result, I spent a good deal of time in front of my PC for hours on end.  So being able to listen to music while working or communicating is a nicety at best.  In the past I\'ve used (tried) many a sound bar - usually those Chinese units with varying names on both eBay and Amazon.  But "none" of them have ever impressed me with their overall sound quality.  Most were very bright sounding little sound bars (that eventually resulted in listener fatigue) that fit or slid in under the PC Monitors.  As of this writing, I\'ve now purchased/tried/reviewed over 15 different compact sound bars.So I went on Amazon and once again looked for something that might fit the bill.  After looking at what seems like dozens of little sound-bars (most of them looking very similar), I came across this Tatronics blue tooth model - read the advertisements and reviews - and elected to purchase this unit.  And boy am I glad I did!  As an aside, I also purchased several other small computer sound-bars - both USB powered and those using power cords (read those other reviews on Amazon).Now keep in mind (going back to my Audiophile days) that speakers do (sound) best when having broken-in the system for several days to a week.  By this, I mean to say that speakers typically will continue to improve after a small period of use and the Taotronics lived up to this expectation.When I first fired them up, I was quite surprised to see that they had a fuller (more complete) sound than I experienced from all of the previous models I used.  They did sound a bit bright at first (not as bad as some of the others), but this tapered off after one to two days of use.  I connected my Taotronics unit via Bluetooth and was quite satisfied to see that any delays between sound and what you are viewing on screen were minimal to non-existent.  Bass-wise, I\'d say they could go down to around 70 HZ (with good musical input) - but the important thing to note here is that once the speakers have been broken in (for example, I left mine on continuously for a few days), the sound lightens up - meaning, music sounds airy with good instrument separation, and the timbre of the instruments are passed through quite well.  I\'m impressed - and I don\'t say that easily.  What is amazing here - at least how I have them set up - is the often audiophile quality to the sound.  My sound stage is large and the instruments have excellent timbre and have that often missed "air" around the instruments.  There is front to rear depth and you can go a long time without getting listening fatigue.  More so, the highs aren\'t shrill - even when you turn up the volume and that\'s great when listening to strings or midrange instruments such as can be found in a classical symphony orchestra.  This speaks volumes for what this speaker can do.  I\'m not a hard rock person - rather, I listen to various classical, jazz, big band, and other pop varieties.The way I have them setup is the following:Sound card being used is the Creative (external)  Blaster X G6.  This is a superb external DAC/sound unit that really ups the ante with regards to smooth and pleasant sounding music (provided the sound input is of good quality).  Garbage in often means garbage out - keep that in mind.b.  In my case I have it connected via Blue Tooth to my system, using the Avantree DG60 Blue Tooth 5.0 USB adapter.3.  I keep the sound bar on continuously and thus the speakers got better and better as each day went on.I tend to listen to classical quite a bit, thus all of the instrumentation involved in a symphony orchestra provides a great test for any type of speaker system.  I was delighted to see how well this Taotronics unit handled various passages of classicial music pieces - in particular, the full dynamics involved with a Crescendo.  Even my wife - who (God bless her) has a tin ear - one time walked past and remarked at how good this Taotronics sound bar sounded.So folks, I\'m not exaggerating here when I say that:1.  Place your quest in finding the next best compact sound bar for computers on hold and then just hit the "buy now" button on Amazon for this Taotronics unit.2.  Once connected, keep it on for several days - let the unit warm up (broken in) - and you will then begin to see a slight (yet noticeable) improvement in overall sound quality.  While it\'s warming in, sure you can use it and enjoy the music, but you will notice slight improvements as time goes on.3.  In the end, in my opinion (notice I said "my opinion") you will be rewarded with a delightful sound quality that belies the small size of this unit.In my opinion (again), this sound bar is the best of the bunch and I\'ve tried many others.  Look for my reviews of a half dozen other small computer sound bars purchased recently on Amazon.In the end, everything we evaluate in life becomes subjective.  When I first got this sound bar I kept the price in mind, but I was totally surprised at the performance levels of this sound bar (again, I have it connected to my PC and I\'m sitting 3 feet away from the sound bar - not across a room).  I can now listening to various musical performances for hours on end and it has become such a joy.Good luck...Ben HerrmannFuquay Varina, NCNOTE:  I edited this review after having owned this particular Taotronics Sound bar for over a month now, thus warranting additional comments.1.  To begin with, all of my initial comments about this sound bar are true, and if I could make the case stronger in their favor, I would.  I\'ve now tried 17 different sound bars - from Bomaker, other Taotronics models, Elegant, and a host of other names - and without question, I find this particular Taotronics sound bar to be the best of the bunch.  Remember, I\'m not saying it\'s the best of the bunch of any sound bar, rather, I want to be more specific, it\'s a superb performer among the compact (under computer monitor) variety.2.  Again, coming from a music listening viewpoint, this unit has a rich, open sound with silky highs and an accurate midrange.  Bass can be surprising (if the original music content has the bass).  Noooooo, this is not a hard rock speaker, so get that out of your mind.  But for those of you who enjoy (as I said above) classical, jazz, big band, various vocals, and certain pop styles, this speaker will be outstanding.3.  In the end, I elected to keep it connected using a high quality audiophile level 3.5 MM cable between the sound bar and the Creative X G6 DAD/Sound unit.  The difference that little cable made was stunning.  As I type this, right now I\'m listening to a live performance of Beethoven\'s Symphony #6 (Pastoral) on line and I am pleasantly stunned at how open this performance is.  You can feel the music hall ambience, and the sound stage seeming extends from the far left of the bar to the far right.  I can\'t ask for more and to have it cost such a small amount of money is the icing on the cake.4.  I can\'t speak for those who didn\'t like it.  I can say that I\'m quite critical about these types of devices and have sent many back.  So far the two I\'ve kept because of their musicality are:  1) This Taotronics Model (7 watts per channel), and the Creative Stage Air (which is also very musical, although has a somewhat more forward sound to it).5.  In fact, I love this Taotronics sound bar so much, I\'m considering getting a 2nd one in the event this one fails in the future - I feel it\'s that good.</review><review> "EDIT AND UPDATE - make sure you go to the website listed on the box so you can download the electronic version (pdf I think) of the user manual ... this will let you email customer support which I did to inquire about the one year warranty.. while you do have to ship a defective speaker back to them to get a replacement, they assured me that they will send a prepaid shipping label so you can mail it back at no cost to yourself.  Have been using the speaker for about 5 days now and so far working great !Okay I will admit I have had this product for all of one entire day  :) .. but I am pretty good about updating my reviews so if you see this same review even a few years from now you can assume I am still happy with the product :)Having said that.. this looks a lot like my old shower mate style bluetooth speaker.. those speakers tended to have a lifetime of a year and a half to two years at most and cost more or less the same as this taotronics model, so I will consider myself lucky if I get a year and a half to two years worth out of this :)  ... I should point out however that I got this at a GREAT price, far lower  than what Taotronics normally charges, so that's one reason I'm so carefree about this :) ... if you want more bang for your buck you may wish to consider the pricier but worth it Tribit XSound Go Bluetooth Speakers amazon asin number B07594HZ6Y (do a search by asin number on the amazon website and it should pop right up)... somewhat more money but trust me you will be pleased, sound quality is amazing and I think you get  what you pay for so I think the Xsound will last longer for you (hopefully?  Just recently purchased Xsound myself so can't say for sure :P ... will update my review there too accordingly when/if  the Xsound dies).Having said that the sound quality on this is not bad for the price I paid, not bad  at all.. the bluetooth speaker comes precharged which is great, charged it anyways and went to full charge  within a few hours or so with the charging cable they provide.. note that the charging cable needs some sort of usb slot to plug into but if you don't have a usb adapter that can plug into a wall / electrical outlet  to begin with you need to order  one from amazon right now these things are essential !  :)I will admit I don't use these in the shower, just a cheap way of being able to boost sound off electronic devices.. again will update this review in the months/years to come if my opinion of this product changes  :)", 'I can\'t say I was blown away by this speaker like everyone else. I\'d say the sound quality is good, but for how much you\'re paying, I think they could do better, or there\'s a better speaker out there for that price. I do enjoy the RGB color, and the bluetooth feature is easy to use and works great. Overall, it\'s a fine speaker, I just think I\'d spend my money elsewhere in hindsight. With that being said, I\'m not upset with my purchase.TaoTronics, if you\'re reading this... I don\'t understand why there\'s no option to remove the "LINE" and "6E" display on the speaker. It\'s obnoxious and looks so stupid. I just assumed I could turn it off when I purchased it, but you can\'t. Buyer beware. Also... if you\'re going to force me to keep it on, at least give me the option to have a clock displayed on it so I\'d know what time it is. That\'d be cool.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Dripstone-Outdoor-Waterproof-Insulated-Polyethylene/dp/B07BW7CHWB/ref=lp_16225009011_1_7822/140-2258924-6159938?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605593052&amp;sr=1-7822</link><review> \ 'If your going to put in the effort of running cable infrastructure why on earth would you install aluminum cabling?

The problem occurs when you need to make an outbound call.  You have to select a line on the base - dial the number - then once the call is in place, if you want to be hands free you have to transfer the call to the Headset.

Even the bone at the outside corner of my hand gets sore from being pressured from the top of my desk. After speaking with some others with similar issues I decided to give this mouse pad a try. I figured that it is a heck of a lot cheaper than if I keep ignoring the problem and end up seeing medical help. I was hopeful, yet a bit skeptical, but after two weeks my wrist is no longer sore - even after a full day of work.

I bought a replacement and find that it no longer works with Windows 10.  Apparently, one of the recent updates to Windows 10 isn\'t compatible with the Lifecams.  It simply won\'t install.  Windows doesn\'t recognize the device at all.  There\' a lot of agitated chatter about it on the Microsoft support forum but no one has a solution.  The only good news is that I found a little manual focus Ausdom webcam that performs just as well as the lifecam and it\'s less than half the price.  Way to go, Microsoft.  Your own lifecam product isn\'t compatible with your own operating system.  You have to wonder how those folks at Microsoft feel about themselves.  There\'s no effort there at all to compensate the customers whose cameras no longer work and no solution in sight.  Those support folks are so incredibly helpless all the time that I\'m sure most of them are in therapy or heavy drinkers or something.**EDIT**  Couple Microsoft updates to Windows 10 later and now the Lifecam installs and runs again.  However, the $25 Ausdom manual focus webcam still out performs it in every way.  The Lifecam "autofocuses" itself into semi blurry status every day and it\'s focus has to be manually reset in the camera controls screen of it\'s software and switched to "Auto" off. Yes, every day.  Pain in the butt.  So the el cheapo webcam at 1/4 it\'s price is still a better choice.  Better picture.  Less hassle. Way cheaper.</review><review> 'I have modern Dell laptop running Windows 10.  I wanted a better webcam than that provided on my laptop.  I also wanted a camera that would integrate seamlessly with my other Microsoft software like Skype and Teams.  So I figured I would be safe buying a Microsoft webcam.  But guess what????  It turns out the Microsoft Web Cams do not work on Windows 10!  I looked all over the internet and found countless cases of consumers who bought this and other Microsoft webcams struggling to make them work with Windows 10.  Apparently the developers of Windows 10, Skype and Teams never thought about users needing to use a webcam.

Shame on Microsoft.</review><review> 'Windows 10 stopped supporting my old webcam. I was a little pissed but the LifeCam VX-1000 was pretty old (but it was Microsoft). I like the replacement LifeCam Studio. Going from VGA resolution to Full HD (1920X1080) is nice. The instructions (pictures) were not that clear and the pointer to the website at the beginning was misleading. There was no software or drivers on the website just PDF copies of the documents that came with the webcam.I guess the best thing to do is to ignore the instructions. With my Windows 10 computer connected to the Internet, I just plugged in the webcam and the drivers downloaded automatically. A couple of the drivers seem to be related to facial recognition. It looks like the webcam automatically focuses on what it recognizes as the subject\'s face.The webcam works with the "Camera" app that is built into Windows 10. It works with other apps, too because apparently this is a UVC standard webcam. There are no controls on the webcam except for a button that you set in software to snap a picture or a burst of pictures or start/stop video and stuff like that. There is a light on the button that comes on when the computer accesses the webcam. "Manual" focusing is done through software. I can get it to focus from a couple of inches to infinity.I found drivers for the VX-1000 after buying this webcam. It looks like Microsoft wrote drivers for my old webcam after I gave up on it.

The only thing that kinda worked for me is to point it directly at a light source when turning it on, as it seems to calibrate based on whatever it is looking at when it first connects.

I tried printing again, still horrible, just horrible quality. So I check the ink, but now, the printer wants MAGENTA and CYAN, yes really.  So I replace the MAGENTA and CYAN and neither of them are full cartridges, there is literally barely any ink in them.So here is what I think, these are not GENUINE BROTHER'S cartridges. These are refurbished, and whoever is filling them with ink, barely fills them. NO ONE should be charged this much money for ink cartridges that have barely any ink in them.

Under the main title, the subtitle shows the color of ink in it\'s font.  Okay, so there was blue, magenta, but no yellow.  I opened the package and it was black.

You may have to shift the phone a few times to get it register for wireless charging. As a slow trickle, it's been alright since I put my phone atop it at night and usually it's at least in the 90% range 5 hours later when I wake up. Without the case, it charged the same amount from 10% to 100% in about 3 hours. The back port for USB charging is also on the weaker side but has been reliable so far, though I mostly use it just to charge my Geekee earbuds. I live out in the boonies, so the fact the radio actually gets a few of my regional stations is impressive. The dual alarms have also functioned just fine so far.

I've always wanted pure power. My first few laptops were purchased based on me weighing how fast it is for the buck.This purchase was different because I had different goals in mind for a laptop. My goal for this purchase was to have the perfect laptop for note taking in college (and to save the hundreds of wasted loose leaf paper used to practice my 5 mathematics courses). The only option for me was a 2 in 1 laptop. After some research, this laptop seemed to give the most bang for the buck. So, here I am!This laptop surprised me in just how premium it felt. It was much thinner than any other laptop I've ever owned, yet it felt sturdier and more secure. Probably because it is made of metal, as opposed to a cheap plastic. I feel like This laptop wont just out of nowhere, have a damaged hinge, like my last laptop did, even though I didn't drop it or anything. It is strong and feels really nice. The metal is a nice matte aluminum, so it feels nice to the touch and doesn't smudge easily.In terms of the performance of this laptop, it is really impressive. This specific laptop in the spin 5 series has impressive stats in every sector of computing. Very nice CPU, with the i7, a lot of ram at high speeds (3200 MHZ I think), and a super speedy NVMe SSD, which makes this thing load stuff almost instantly. It even turns on from being booted off almost instantly. Its very nice and perfect for people who need a computer that is usable the instant that they need it.The touchscreen with the wacom pen is amazing, plain and simple. The touchscreen feels better than my smart phone, so obviously I think its great, and the pen feels almost like i'm writing on paper. More like a slightly sticky whiteboard, but still. Because of that, I believe that 98% of what I write down next semester will be on this bad boy. It just completely replaces pen and paper. Now I can feel better because I am not wasting so much paper.Now for some downsides. The screen aspect ratio is stupid. Yes, I said it, having a taller screen is a thing of the past yet this laptop thought it could get away with it. It looks stupid and feels stupid. Videos now have huge upper and lower black bars, which wastes screen real estate. They even advertise the taller screen as a feature, as if it is a new technology. Come on!This laptop is kind of hard to open. You definitely need two hands to do it and you have to tilt it up to where the hinge is down and the part that it opens is facing up and then you have to pry it open. I think its like this because of the magnets they use to keep it closed. Its not the worst thing, because of how I love this computers features, but It does annoy me.The touchpad is hard to click with. You have to press pretty hard so it makes clicking a little clunky. It isn't the end of the world, but mac books are definitely easier in this sector.And that is about it in the cons department. I highly recommend this product. If you don't mind the cons that I listed, this laptop is perfect for being on the go!", "I bought this laptop for 2 reasons; the 16GB/512GB extra storage, and the active stylus.First the bugs; there's no way to know these things until after I bought it. The charger isn't a USB-C which is the new fad, it's one of the old style. The charger is much smaller and lighter than the others I have used, so that's a plus worth mentioning, just not as small as a phone charger... The USB-A port doesn't go all the way in - on both sides (WTF?) the USB-C ports do though. The SD card slot has a similar problem of sticking out too far for comfort. The stylus position is right next to a screw hole, so a few times I have tried to rip out the screw trying to pull the stylus out... You have to get used to the position, or actually pull up the side to check where you are grabbing - it's just way too close. There is a noticable gap between the base and screen, with a fan out the back trying to use that space for ventilation - which isn't used well since the laptop heats up (this is when using a heavy data-cruncher) to an almost un-holdable temperature in just a few minutes. During 'normal' usage, the temperature is well regulated and comfortable, but under high loads it can't be on a lap.Sound and video are superb =) I wasn't looking for high quality video, but my expectations were exceeded. Great for binging. The battery lasts (these are guesses, not calculations) for ~8 hours doing text editing, ~6 hours binging on youtube, but only ~2 doing data crunchingSecond the stylus. I need a stylus to write math formulas down during video conferencing. It works pretty accurately, but the main problem is that the screen is too flimsy to support writing on it even if i try to put my other hand behind the monitor. If I try to rotate to tent-mode the writing works better, but the camera can't figure out how to flip itself (and there are no app options to flip the camera vertically), and similarly I can't just put it down flat because it wants to change to tablet mode, and can't see me on the ceiling...The big problem with the stylus I found out when I contacted customer service. I expected to get a few extra tips for the stylus in the box, but no. I asked if they sell the tips - they don't. I asked which tips are the right size - they don't know. I asked what styluses are compatible - they said the one it comes with. I asked if they sell the stylus itself - they do, but they don't know how much it costs unless they order it (WTF?) and can't order one unless the original is broken... So the one tip on the one stylus is all you get if you buy this. When I was using it I also found out the hard way that the stylus battery only lasts about an hour, but can be recharged in just a few seconds. Very disappointed in the no-replacement of the stylus.Third the storage; The RAM is 16GB of DDR4-3200 dual-lane. I don't know why they can't say that in the tech specs, but they didn't. The hard drive is 512GB, but came with 50-60GB pre-filled.", 'This is a great computer at a fair price that is really close to being an outstanding computer.Pros:Beautiful screen, fast, excellent port selection for size, lightweight, great keyboard feel, good value and nice build qualityCons:Plastic touchpad (super disappointing given the gorilla glass screen), touchpad off centre to the keyboard and the palm rest (need to turn off 1 finger right clicking or be faced with lots of inadvertent right clicks), cluttered text on the keys (seriously who needs to see the fake numberpad?), questionable stylus accuracy, small amount of light bleed along the bottom, poor fingerprint reader, no USB-C port on the rightWould be close to perfect with a glass touchpad, USB-C ports on both sides for charging convenience, and a more simple keyboard without the cluttered simulated numberpad.</review><review> "I've been using the laptop for about three days now and so far it's been performing quite well. This laptop is really nice and compact. It has been perfect for my online schooling. As a university student who's always on the go and likes to do some digital art on the side, this was the perfect fit. The processor is quite fast. It does come with a backlit keyboard, however I do hope that it came at different levels of brightness and it would've been great if the screen was matte as it wouldn't capture as much fingerprints when I do use that function. You can hear the fan sometimes, but it really isn't that loud to the point that it's disturbing. Overall, I have not had any problems in using it these past few days.", "I would buy this laptop again. On the whole, I'm quite happy with it. My model has 16 gigs of ram and 512 gigs of storage, which is more than enough for most people. It has a really terrific screen in a 3:2 ratio. You can't find a 2k screen that format at this price point anywhere. The touchscreen works great and the computer flips nicely into tablet mode. The pen is skinny, but works well and the fact that it docks in the chassis is very handy. I appreciate the touch-button login, which has been working fine for me. But you can see where Acer cut costs to get us that screen: the trackpad is not glass and I find that my fingers don't slide well on it. The touchpad click is crackly, not crisp. The keys have little travel and it's a bit clickety-clakety typing on the thing. The speakers are not very good, but the bundled DTS does help get passable sound out of some pretty poor hardware. Still, it's fine for watching videos. I wouldn't use it as a music player, though.Acer, if you're listening: put a glass trackpad on this laptop, and give the keys another millimetre of travel and you'd have a near perfect machine that would put Surface and Mac to shame.", "It's light and and looks sturdy and fast performance with the params. Comparing with the market and price in USA and Canada, this one has good price &amp; performance. At least, it's almost same price between US ($1099) and Canada ($1399), even cheaper. For me, I'm not gamer and GPU killer (machine learning something), so normal usage is enough. I opened VirtualBox, multi-chrome with 4k video, Edge, word, etc. It's still smooth. The touchscreen is useful if you have a lot of work for note, drawing, etc.  The data transfer is really fast, tested by software tool. One is internal ssd, the other is through USB 3.0 ssd. I tried to look at the Zenbook at BB, but if you have this one, then you would forget it. All in all, it has good price, good performance, and is easy to use."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Straight-Eco-Friendly-Bristles-Hairbrush-Detangling/dp/B07BN6STWX/ref=lp_16225006011_1_1898/130-8855266-5166633?s=beauty-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605595211&amp;sr=1-1898#customerReviews</link><review> \ 'This brush is amazing!

It kinks easily just by pulling it out of the box.Reading afterwards the description, I realize that is a Copper clad aluminium cable. Which isn't the same as a solid copper cable at all. It's basically an aluminium wire that is copper plated. Aluminium is much softer and this explains the easy kinks and the stranded feels the cable have.I'd recommend this cable if you want to make a bunch of patch cable for non-PoE devices. As soon as PoE is involved, I would recommend real solid copper cabling.Also, on longer run, you will have speed issue, the whole 1Gbit might not be achievable. The longest cable I've ran from this wire is about 50 feets, I have no problem with the speed, but some user reviews at 75 feets are having speed issue.", "I got about a half way into the box and ran into a big knot while on a job and ended up cutting out a bunch of cable. had to take the box and open it up to find big knots and overlapping stuff that basically prevented me from continuing to pull wire. wasn't too impressed. usually a decent product but obviously a bad run.", "Very poor cable, i guess that's why it's under 100 bucks and solid copper cable is 300", "It is best price but I am very weird.How come this cable fit to cat5 connector?I knew cat6 wire is more thicker than cat5..I think this cable made as cat6 design but it use same wire as cat5.

Flex is non existent.The RGBs on the back and over the IO are nice.I do wish the second M.2 PCI SSD slot came with a heat spreader as well.The board itself-Great. No issues whatsoever.It\'s a 5 star board, except for one big thing.The BIOS sucks. It\'s terrible.It has less features then the M5A99FX Pro R2.0 (My old board from about 6 years ago)The AMD RAID Expert Utility is a pain to even navigate. When selecting options with the mouse, they usually don\'t actually change. You must use arrow keys and enter.This BIOS fails to recognize PCI RAID Controllers. If you use a RAID card, you won\'t be able to configure it in the BIOS or boot from it. But yet if it\'s pre-configured, Windows will recognize it in the file explorer/disk management.The menus that you\'ll actually be using are buried inside irrelevant options.Windows 7 and this board are not a possibility as well.It took me about two days of errors and reboots to get Windows 10 to install and actually boot. Pray it goes smooth your first time, as the rest will not. The board still thinks I\'ve got two Windows 10 installations despite wiping all my drives.Fun times.Also, POST times vary from 5-60 seconds making this the SLOWEST POST I\'ve ever seen. Windows 10 loads in literally 1 second for me, but I have to wait sometimes a full minute to get there.If you don\'t have RAID setup in the BIOS it\'s quicker-5-25 seconds instead.***Update***Unfortunately I have to update this to 1 star. The BIOS is that bad. Not only is it just painful to use, it lacks basic functionality.For instance, I got a NVMe m.2 ssd. Installed it, found it in the BIOS, tested it. It works. I boot up windows, it doesn\'t show in disk management. Further digging reveals in device manager, it is there but you must toggle "show hidden devices." The properties on it revealed that windows recognized it as currently disconnected.After jerking around the BIOS, I tried turning NVMe RAID on. The device now shows in Windows, but as legacy support and not capable of the PCI gen 4 speeds I was after.There is no and I mean no reason turning RAID on should make it populate.If you are like me and have a lot of storage (10 drives total: 2 M.2, 1 M.2 nvme, 1 SATA SSD, 6 SATA HDDs) this motherboard is not for you.I spent countless hours finagling settings to get it running. This is a process for my last motherboard that actually didn\'t even need the BIOS for anything other than the boot order and to access my PCI RAID controller.I really wanted to like this motherboard, but Gigabyte paid almost no attention to one of the most important aspects of it.</review><review> "A lot of one star reviews will say this board is DOA. I thought mine was too, but it's not!Be patient! Here's what happened.When you power the board, the LED lights should flash initially. This is a good sign. Press the power button or trip the pins with a screwdriver, if it doesn't respond, that doesn't mean it's dead. WAIT ~15 MINUTES AFTER PRESSING THE POWER BUTTON.***Turns out my mobo was busy resetting BIOS, and after it was finished it powered up normally. Make sure this isn't the case with your board before thinking it's DOA.***I had tripped the pins after troubleshooting the problem to the board and was feeling pretty defeated, I started to look at returning this and buying a replacement board. As soon as I added a replacement to the cart, fans started spinning and led strips came on.Now, I'm not saying that this is the best board. The fact that there was no led indicator or ANY indication really that the bios was updating/resetting straight from the box made me monumentally frustrated. If I hadn't left it powered up in defeat for that long I absolutely would have returned it, because there was nothing (not even a forum post after googling) suggesting that this might happen. Now that I got it to work, though, it's fine! Boot time is a little slow, but it handles my Ryzen 3700 just fine, and is ultimately a great board for the price.", "Good value and nice vrms.I built a 3700x, 1660 super, 2x16gb lpx vengeance 3200mhz build and turns out if I use the a1/b1 slots for my 2 sticks of ram and use the XMP profiles, the bios either reset or I just plain need to reset it cause nothing would boot. a2/b2 solved the issue but I hope if I were to increase to 4 sticks the bios would take it and boot properly.Another complain would be the only 1 system fan port, my case came with 3 fans and I need splitters. Only a small annoyance but usually there is more than 1.Also just saying, you should plug your cpu fan into the usb port on the motherboard if you want to control the fans's outer ring rgb, using the rgb port just beside the cpu only allows you to control the fan rgb.", "I was a little concerned getting a return from the Amazon warehouse. The last time I got a board like that it had a dead DIMM slot. This worked fatastically out of the box. The board is paid on a RTX 2070 super and a 3800x ryzen cpu with 32gb of Trident Z Royal 3600. After updating to the newest bios, I was able to get the full 3600mhz speed out of the ram and everything is totally functional. The only feature missing in this board (which is surprising) is no type c ports. Otherwise it's a good performer and worth the value."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Tommy-Bahama-Topical-Orchid-Quilt/dp/B008H2NY8I/ref=sr_1_2117?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Home+bedding&amp;qid=1605597117&amp;s=kitchen-intl-ship&amp;sr=1-2117</link><review> \ "I've been wanting this quilt for so long because it looks really pretty in the picture.

My phone doesn't have any EQ which would let you tweak the sound stage.ComfortThe fit is secure yet very comfortable, no ear fatigue and have a low profile. They have the usually selection of different sized buds and rubber hooks, so achieving the right fit shouldn't be an issue.FunctionalityTouch controls work perfectly. You can play/pause, adjust volume, skip, answer/reject calls and summon your voice assistant (Google or Siri) Either ear bud can be used too which is very useful feature.ConnectivityNo issues here either to the phone or between the buds. I can leave my phone in one room and walk into other with no drop out.Battery LifeIndependent reviewers have confirmed the stated battery life is accurate. Of course this will vary dependent on volume levels. That's true of all makes. I'm never going to have them in my ears for 5hrs. It's great how they charge whilst in the case.Build QualityNo issues here and the hinge on the case is sturdy.PriceAt this price point, you won't find better. Seriously, give them a try :)", "I am extremely happy with these earbuds. I had been looking to buy wireless earbuds for a while, and finally took the plunge after spending a lot of time reading reviews. These earbuds came highly recommended, and I could see why as soon as I received them! They quickly auto connect to your device, and I was worried they would not work with my Bluetooth 4 laptop, but they work fantastic! I received them four days ago and wanted to test them out for a few days before writing my review. At first, they started to feel quite uncomfortable in my ear, but after wearing them for a few days, it seems my ears just had to adjust to having something in there - I just came off a 4 hour call with them and feel no discomfort! On that note, I am very happy with the battery life. I typically use them for 2-4 hours at a time, and have not had them die on me yet. The sound is very clear with excellent bass, and the touch controls are so easy to work. I have used these with Zoom, Discord, Facebook Video calls, normal phone calls, listening to music, and they have worked great for all. The noise cancelling on these is absolutely unreal - there has been construction on my street this week, and with these in listening to music, I forgot the construction was even happening. I love how seamlessly these work with my devices, and its been fantastic to have that wireless connection. The fit in the ear is very snug and I would have no problem running or playing sports with these in. If you're on the fence, definitely get these!"</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q34QC74/ref=lp_16225007011_1_603_twi_col_ti_3/134-7668194-4119119?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605593911&amp;sr=1-603</link><review> \ 'Very surprised at the effectiveness of this.Using this on a 2018 13" i7 MacBook Pro.

Overall, I am very impressed with both!!  The Havit and the Tree New Bee both dropped the temperature of the laptop by 10 degree Celsius during idle temp and dropped 4 degree Celsius during a 10 minute benchmark test.  The only thing that made this one better was that it is whisper quiet (I could not hear it running at all).  After testing, I prefer the havit because it is quieter and it drops the temperature of my laptop by 10 degrees so the fan doesn\'t go into the high-speed mode unless I am doing something to require high CPU or GPU utilization.Picture 1 - without cooler on a flat deskPicture 2 - Havit - model F2056Picture 3 - Tree New Bee - model K0025Tests performed on a 15.6" laptop with a 4700MQ processor</review><review> 'Hace tiempo que quer&#237;a comprar una base refrigeradora para mi port&#225;til.

I had to buy a small desk fan and put that beside the laptop blowing air away from it, as well as using this pad, and temperatures of the laptop are still between 75 and 85 degrees Celsius, depending on how warm the house is.  Without the desk fan it was reaching 90+ degrees.  The fps does drop at those temperatures as the computer attempts not to melt.As I said though, for every day things it keep the laptop around 45 degrees.  It works for slightly more intensive things such as Photoshop as well, keeping it around 50 to 55 degrees with no lagging, which is entirely acceptable.If you\'re not looking for something to use during gaming this board works great and I would recommend it.  The build is light but feels sturdy enough, only thing that hasn\'t lasted is one of the sticky corners to prevent it sliding around, but I did catch it on the edge of the desk a number of times.  It\'s not silent at any time, you can hear it running from a few feet away but it\'s not an abrasive sound, you get used to it, and you don\'t hear it if you\'re wearing headphones.  Though I\'m not horribly picky about it being super quiet, so.  The blue lights are bright but pretty and not distracting or painful for the eyes, especially as your laptop covers the majority of them.  It\'s also nice that it has two USB ports, one for plugging in the board itself, leaving you with an extra.Pros:-Light and travel convenient-Sturdy build-Cheap-Spare USB port-Two props on backside if you want it angled-Fits 17" laptops nicely-Extremely easy to useCons:-Not up to the demands of gaming-Not completely silent if you care about it being silentOverall the only reason I didn\'t give this a five star rating is because of it\'s limitations to being an everyday use only laptop.  If it could handle gaming it\'d be pretty close to perfect.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Streaming-Business-Microphone-AutoFocus-NexiGo/dp/B08BY1JWHG/ref=lp_16225007011_1_1821/138-4193517-5940957?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594331&amp;sr=1-1821#customerReviews</link><review> \ "I had a difficult time trying to find a good webcam.

I ordered these because I was having yet ANOTHER breakout around my chin. After I ordered, I had a cold sore pop up. Sigh.

I had popped it once but it seemed like there was still a lot of &#8220;stuff&#8221; under the skin so I stuck one of these on it- the thought- why not- and stuck one on my cold sore too (it was in the oozy, crusty stage-sorry) and went to bed. I woke up and forgot I had them on until I looked in the mirror- they had started clear but in the morning looked white all around the pimple and cold sore. I carefully peeled them off and... gross. They had definitely pulled out all of the pus/ nastiness. These come with a ton of patches for the price on all different sizes, they appear pretty clear on, and I think it would be easy to put makeup over them if you wanted.

I thought it would reduce the redness of it and make it less noticeable and inflamed but instead it pulled the white stuff out which you would think would be good but when I took it off it actually hurt a little while it extracted the pus. For other pimples it didn&#8217;t do much. I will not be repurchasing. I was really disappointed because these got such good reviews. Maybe I set my expectations to high.

After shipping delays the controller seemed to work fine for a month or two with little difficulty. The programmable buttons were a nice feature, and one of the few issues I ran into was if my headset became unplugged my mic would not function until I reset the console. Unfortunately the right trigger (the primary button in FPS games) will randomly act as if pressed despite not having my finger on it at all. It started off with a phantom tap here and there, and now will act as if I was holding down the trigger at random intervals. This is a huge issue as most of the game modes I play have "friendly fire" and randomly shooting when teammates are around is a problem. Whether you pay $30 for this or $60 for a M$ controller you will get a failure from one of the bumpers or triggers eventually. It is insane that no one can create a quality product 1st or 3rd party.</review><review> 'I just received this today and have played with it a little over 2 hours, but I\'m very impressed with it for the price. I have both an xBox 360 wired controller and the Steam controller (which is my main controller for games like Rocket League and indies) in place, and wanted this because I like the form factor of the 360, but find the rear paddles on the Steam controller crucial for how I play. I\'m extremely pleased to say in that criteria, the Power A Enhanced controller meets this mix perfectly! It feels great, and the rear triggers are well placed, though not nearly as large as the Steam. The thumbsticks are excellent and have comfortable gripping for constant use. The surface does have a great feel, and the overall build is strong and solid.The area where it loses a half star for me is the squishiness of the triggers and rear paddle buttons. It\'ll take some getting used to, but I don\'t think it\'s a deal-breaker by any means. Another area (which caused me to check off the 4 stars) is the "proprietary" cable you need to use for the controller. It\'s a long cable for sure (9.8ft), but like someone else mentioned, the cable jack has a notch that only accepts their usb connector - it\'s no different than any micro-usb connector, but only theirs will fit. The triggers are also a little cheaper in their plastic quality over the 360 controller or the Steam, but they don\'t wobble or feel like they will break under use. Setting the rear paddles is extremely easy, and a no-brainer.Overall, the feel, build, and options set this above the class competition - especially at anything even close to this price-point. There are some minor quibbles, but to get these options elsewhere in this form factor, you\'d be able to buy 4 of these in its place. It\'s worth a purchase and I will consider another to build out multiplayer options going forward.***Update: October \'18I felt I needed to update my star rating and explanation. I have dropped the quality to a 3, as the rear paddle buttons are not consistent. As a more specific answer, playing Rocket League, my rear right paddle is set to boost. During a match, there are intermittent times when the button will not function, drastically changing the outcome of my jump, clear, shot, etc. In training mode, I\'ve been able to recreate the button not working using the same force, angle, pressure as when it does work, though I cannot determine the frequency of the issue. This is very disappointing as it is still a great controller in every other sense.***Update: October \'18No reply from company through their customer support system. The rear AGR button continues to get worse, often acting as nothing is happening (not even a delay). I have no confidence in this controller and I\'m VERY DISAPPOINTED in the quality at this point. It\'s JUNK. Seriously, do not buy this. Save yourself the headache and get something better. To Power A - We gave you a chance to put out a product and support it. YOU FAILED.*****Update December \'18:I FINALLY received service after multiple attempts to contact and get the replacement going (calling seemed to help, but it was clearly a 3rd party company that sounded like it doubles as a daycare in the background). I filled out the email they sent me 3 different times (including the tiny numbers on the back of the controller), and was finally sent a replacement for free. Kudos for that. BUT... the replacement controller has a sticking "A" button right out of the box. This stuff is JUNK. Avoid this if possible. It\'s a great idea that meets the "wants" of a controller with this ability (rear buttons), but falls extremely short in delivering anything of quality.I\'m not even going to bother with another round of customer service. Going to eat my losses and go back to my Steam Controller.</review><review> "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0I'm giving this controller a one star because it has some pretty drastic ghosting on the left trigger, makes FPS games nearly impossible to play competitively (See video).

However i managed to pick up and Xbox one with 2 controllers in a Black Friday deal and those controllers are so much more comfortable than this one so I just use one of those now instead and this sits in my draw..</review><review> 'So I got this controller originally as I don\'t want to pay silly money for a genuine Microsoft controller and I found this controller to be really good value, looks smart and had some good reviews on YouTube.However I ordered a replacement for the first controller within less than a day of receiving it.  The AGB (Advanced Gaming Buttons) on the back of the controller were temperamental and did not always work when pressed.  Other than that though the controller was great.Anyway the replacement arrived, I tried it for a day and the left analogue stick is shockingly bad... as you move it in circles it feels like it is grinding against the casing and any circular movement to the extremities of the left stick is grinding.  I don\'t know what it grinds on but it feels really bad.  The right stick on the other hand is really smooth and feels perfect as they both did on the first controller.So anyway, I\'ve just ordered a replacement of the replacement and I\'m keeping my fingers crossed for a replacement with no issues.Some people my think "well you get what you pay for" and in some cases that is true but I still expect it to function as advertised and as expected.Should the second replacement not be up to standard when it arrives I will get a refund, get a different controller and change my review to 1 star and If it is working well then I will change to 3 stars but I\'\'m not holding my breath.On now to looking at the rest of the controller... It looks great and feels good in your hands although I felt a little forced into putting my index fingers on the bumpers and middle fingers on the triggers and it felt comfortable to hold like that but unnatural to play, as  I personally prefer to use my index fingers on the bumpers and triggers together.Speaking about the bumpers they do feel a little weak and I refrained from pressing with too much force.  They feel like they would break after a few intense gaming sessions.All of the face buttons work very well and are reliable but for me they need to travel too far back up after a press before another press can be registered.  This can cause problems in games where you need to double jump like Rocket League or do multiple presses in quick succession.The vibration from the rumble motors is not the strongest I\'ve felt but it\'s also not the weakest.  My gripe though is that the spin-down takes a while so after you\'ve been hit in game and the controller vibrates.  There is no break on the motor so it keeps spinning for a half second longer than it should.  The spin-up however is good and you do feel the rumble when expected, but it just lasts too long.USB Cable is nice and long and fits really well into the controller, is solid and is one of the best fits for a Micro USB cable I\'ve ever dealt with so big thumbs up for that.Finally the d-pad although responsive does feel quite spongy and I think it\'d not be very good for fighting games or twitch reflex platform games.Final thought:  If I received a controller with the analogue sticks of the first controller and the buttons of the second then this would\'ve been a strong 4 star review.Pros:Looks greatStrong USB connectionLong cablePotential for greatnessResponsive d-padCons:Bumpers feel weakLong rumble spin downHigh release height on face buttonsSpongy d-padHit \'n\' miss quality'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Brother-FAX-2840-Speed-Laser-Machine/dp/B008OG5W3M/ref=lp_16225007011_1_2047/140-7961046-5874320?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594415&amp;sr=1-2047#customerReviews</link><review> \ 'This machine is NOT working for us!!!

The braiding is very well done - not too stiff, not to supple/thin.  The connectors are very solid - the USB C ends snap in securely but also remove with a tug.  Not too easy, not too difficult.I have no problems using Qualcomm Quick Charge with this cables.I have stashed one in my movie room, one in my car, and one in my desk - I have owned these for about a month now and all are still going strong.Overall, this is a great deal in USB C Cables and will support Qualcomm quick charge for your android tablet or phone.  It can also handle file transfers, though if you're transferring a significant number of files or using an external hard drive, card reader, etc. I would recommend upgrading to USB 3.0 cables!", "If you need a good durable cable... buy these. works with quick charge 4 on my razer phone 2. I have been using Anker powerlien cables playng ingress and Pokemon go for years, a normal cable end will be frayed and fail in a few months but these last years. honestly I end up giving them away or losing them before they stop working. I have one of their powerline  micro usb cables that has seen daily use for 2 years and is still working for quick charge on my galaxy s7 (son uses for poekmon go) . you don't need something this robust just if its going to sit on a nightstand, but these are perfect to carry on you with a battery pack (i also like anrker batter packs the most, having owned several brand's, them and ravpower are the best 2 there)", 'These are nicely designed cables and I appreciated the different lengths.  I plan on using the 6\' and 10\' lengths for travel and the red makes the cable easy to see so I don\'t leave it anywhere.I tested all three cables briefly with my Samsung wall adapter and my computer.  When plugged into the wall adapter, my phone reported that it was "Fast charging".  When using the cables to connect the phone to my computer, it loaded the USB interface and allowed me to view and copy files over.  I can\'t speak to durability and longevity yet, but I\'ll update my review if anything changes.The nylon braiding means that it will need some sort of strap to keep it coiled, although this nylon braiding is somewhat less stiff than other nylon cables I\'ve used.  Each cable comes with one Velcro strap, but I find them tedious to use and instead use a thick, black rubber band that\'s quick and easy to slip over the coiled cable (pictured).</review><review> 'I\'ve been having problems with Galaxy S8 reporting "slow charging". I noticed these messages were frequently associated with bad cables so I bought some of these Anker USB-C cables. No more slow charging message.It seems that the cable quality is important with USB-C ports; more so than older devices. I\'m glad I bought these.</review><review> "usually, most times without hesitation I would rate Anker products exceptional, sometimes with my eyes closed, unfortunately, this time, nada... Bought this three pack, only until now I realize that two out of the three don't fit into the port(3ft &amp; 6ft), tho little could be said about the material quality, &amp; if it's anything like the micro USB I've purchased in the past, I would highly doubt or question its durability, but the end results it all boils down to being stuck with two useless cords when I paid for three", "Nice leads, though bit more expensive then some other good brands out there. On the longer 3m lead the USB-C was fine in my Motorola but would slipout of my son's Samson lifted which did not happen with other brands.The 1m lead became more of a problem when the USB-A refused to work unless wiggled around in the charger. Again this is not the case with other brands that I have and is the same in 8 USB-A ports that I've tried so is a fault with the lead which is a shame.Update to this review: When I did the 7 month review I also sent an email to Anker customer support with the same information. They emailed back within 2 hrs and arranged a replacement pack of all three leads be sent put by Amazon. These have after a few days of testing proved to be fine and so I have changed my 3 stars to 5. A few &#163; more but you get an 18 month warrenty which which they act on.", "I've been using Anker cables for a couple of years now. They are so strong and durable. I use them indoors, in the car, and even when camping where they do not get treated to well. The 3 pack is great value with the different lengths ideal for my various uses.", "I've bought a number of Anker chargers over the years and have recommended them to everyone I know. They are brilliant and I havent had to replace one yet. In fact these chargers outlast my phones!", "Anker cables are always great.

My friends have a few and read a lot of reviews and watched a lot of videos. THIS CAMERA came out on top as the winner for me. I will start the review by listing the pros and cons.PROS- 1080p or lower resolution. Can be changed to save space on your storage device.- Accessible through laptop or mobile device. (I'm using iPhone 6s)- Night vision is stellar!- adjustable contrast/brightness/color and more. Very detailed option.- Accessible while at work or anywhere when you are away from home.- small and quiet. I can't even hear the camera moving.- comes with detailed instructions and a wall mount- motion and sound detections.- microSD card for storage of recordings.- mic and speaker built in- high range of motionCONS:- app doesn't always automatically open up camera feed.- can lag depending on connection. (not a big deal and actually kind of expected)As you can see, there are hardly any down sides to this wonderful little camera. I absolutely love it. I currently have it inside. I suppose you could mount it outside if it is under a patio and you live in mild climates, but I doubt think its meant to be an outside camera. Not sure. I bought it for inside use. My favorite features are the APP itself. I can check on my house during work and get updates if it detects motion or sound. The best! I also like the size. Until I received it in the mail, I assumed it was much bigger. Its very small and well built. Doesn't look bad on a shelf either. Would make a great nanny cam as well. I would recommend this to anyone. They are steps ahead of the competition. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.", "I've been using the Amcrest 720 for a few months, and recently added the 1080. Both cameras have performed well and do an excellent job. These cameras offer a very nice solution for DIY home surveillance or monitoring, and the feature set is very impressive (especially considering the price).Cameras are packaged very well, and come with a a mounting bracket (if you want to mount on a wall), a generously long power cord, an Ethernet cable (which I did not need since I did the wireless setup), the CD software, and instructions. Instructions are well written, very easy to follow.As for setup, some reviewers report problems or complain about confusion with the software (more on software below), but in my experience the initial setup was straightforward. You have several options, the most common including either wired setup (use supplied Ethernet cable to connect to your router) or wireless setup (using your WiFi). I used wireless setup for both cameras using the Android app. The process is to simply choose to add a device in the app, and scan the QR code (printed on the base of the camera) using the app (or manually enter the serial number), then name the device, provide your WiFi credentials for the device, and you're done.As for the software, I did find it just a bit confusing to understand my options when first exploring the camera. Here's what you have:* Android mobile app Lite and Pro versions - I have installed and used both the Lite and Pro versions, and both work fine, but the Pro version gives you some additional features (one of which is Push notifications, so you can get an alert on your cell for events like motion detection). The Pro version was not free in the past, thus the the two apps. But since it's now free, the Pro version is the best choice.* Amcrest IP Config  - this application allows you to configure many options for your camera, including the ports, basic video monitoring settings, video encoding options (quality) for your main stream and sub stream (the camera can record in two separate streams, giving you the flexibility of monitoring using one stream, and recording using another), and firmware upgrades. In addition, using the IP Config tool, you can launch a browser-based configuration tool for even more settings and features. While multiple browsers are supported, I use Chrome, and with Chrome you must install the Amcrest app (free from the Chrome App Store). With IE, simply install the ActiveX plugin the first time you browse to the IP address of the camera. The browser-based config tool (Chrome app or using IE) includes tons of configuration options and the interface is very good. This is my preferred method of monitoring, configuring, and playback/review.* Amcrest Surveillance Pro - this application includes much of the same functionality as provided by the IP Config and the browser-based applications (like the Chrome app). When setting up my first camera, I started with this application, and while it includes all the features you need, and allows you to configure events and other options, the interface is really not intuitive. You'll have to spend some time exploring to get the most out of this tool. I understand that Amcrest is working on development of a new application, which will be welcomed.* PC-NVR - this is a software (PC) based Network Video Recorder application, allowing you to store you videos on your PC. I'm not using this feature.* You can use other applications too (most will support Amcrest (Foscam) cameras. Blue Iris is a popular choice. Even for the mobile app, other options are available (tinyCam Monitor, for example, which works fine).As for storage, for now I'm just storing on SD cards in each camera. Based on documentation I've seen, the largest capacity is 32Gb, so that's what I have in each camera. By default, it'll record on a loop, so oldest files are removed as space is exhausted. You can customize this if you'd prefer to get an alert when space is full (rather than overwrite). You also have the option of NAS or FTP. Amcrest offers free cloud-based storage for one camera, but this includes only 4 hours of retention (that's 4 total hours, not 4 hours of recorded video, so this really has very limited value). So if you want cloud-based storage, and you don't want to pay for a subscription to the Amcrest Cloud service, you'll need to have an FTP server. Sadly, cloud-based storage from Dropbox, Google Drive, and others are not supported (you will need a cloud-based storage solution that includes FTP functionality).You have many configuration options for recording, including motion detection, audio detection, and various alerts (video tampering, SD card errors, network errors, camera masking, etc.). The motion detection works very well, and is highly configurable (so you can establish zones for the motion detection and configure sensitivity as needed to prevent false alarms). Cameras also include night vision, and this works quite well (even in a very dark room or space).A note on mobile app push notifications (a feature whereby you can receive an alert based on events, such as motion detection)... until recently there were issues with getting the push notifications to work reliably. I experienced problems, but the Android app was updated very recently to address this issue, and push notifications have been working great since the update. If you have an issue, just delete and re-add your camera to your mobile app, then re-enable/save the push notification option.Finally, regarding support. I've only needed to reach out to Amcrest once (for a simple issue I should have been able to resolve on my own), and I found them to be very responsive and helpful. Their tech support rep (Alex) resolved the issue quickly.", 'These cameras are great. The quality of the picture is fantastic. The motion detection works very well and controlling them via your mobile phone is easy. The actual software set up can take a little time as there are so many options available, however once you play around with it for a bit you realise how powerful the camera is. I also own a Home Monitor HD camera which is also very good, but unlike the Amcrest Pro HD it is static. The ability to move the camera left/right and up/down via you phone is very useful. The Home Monitor HD does have one significant advantage in that you get a 7 day free cloud storage service for any recorded motion detected, with the Amcrest you will have to pay for this service. I currently use the camera with an SD card and and a NAS so I cannot say how good the Amcrest cloud servers are.My only slight criticism is the the app which I use via my phone was temperamental at times. I found I often had to close it completely and restart it and it would work fine. I have noticed the app has improved with updates since my purchase and hopefully this will continue to be the case. I had one of these running for month with regular use and I was happy enough with the performance to purchase a second camera.</review><review> 'These cameras are amazing! I have a professionally installed HD CCTV system and I was looking for a Onvif compatable wifi camera which would connect to my NVR. I brought one to test and I was so impressed with it I have now purchased three in total.

The manual is actually quite well written in English and not in broken English like so many made in China items. It is also in German, French, Spanish, and Italian languages. Speaking of languages, this MP3 player boasts up to 26 languages you can select, which includes Asian languages. Color me impressed!In the packaging, you get 1 screen protector, which I suggest you apply with tweezers so you don\'t get your fingerprints on it. I wish the company included an extra set for mess-ups, but that is my first minor gripe. The MP3 player comes encased in a protetive sleeve. The included earbuds are basic but will get the job done if you don\'t have a higher quality set of earbuds. My second gripe is that the earbuds are the kind where you have to pull apart the wiring to separate them (see my picture). I guess the company did this so you can adjust the length of the earbud wire separation to your desired length but I\'d prefer it\'d be already done. The included Micro USB charge cord is 21". Charging is supposed to take 1-3 hours and the unit was already partially charged when I started charging it so it took less than an hour for me to max out the charge before my first usage. The armband has a plastic see-through cover and the band appears to be neoprene, which is expandable and breathable. Battery life is phenomenal and I believe the 55 hour rating. I left it on overnight and it was still at 4 full bars when I woke up. The manual says music playback time is 48 hours with headphones and 13 hours with the internal speaker. Video playback time is 9 hours with headphones and 5 hours with the speaker.The main folder menu is easy to navigate with the following selection options: Music, Videos, FM radio, Recordings, Bluetooth, Pictures, EBook, Settings, Folder View. Setting up the date and time was a breeze. You have your choice of date display formats and 12 or 24 hour time formats. One thing that I really liked about the MP3 player was the ability to lock buttons. This prevents you from accidentally turning off the unit. You also can turn on or off the LED selection buttons or leave them on, but my major gripe is that the brightness of the LED buttons can\'t be adjusted if you leave it on. They are bright blue! The bluetooth pairing worked great with my speaker. If you don\'t connect an earbud or speaker, the MP3 player has an internal speaker, but don\'t expect great sound. It\'s just basic enough and loud enough for you to hear what you need. There is a calendar function, which just serves as reference. What a really liked was the alarm. You can set the alarm once, daily, or on work days (M-F?). Unfortunately, you can\'t set what qualifies as a work day. You can use an included ring for the alarm or choose music from your internal or card memory. There\'s also a stopwatch and pedometer. COOL! However, you can\'t start the pedometer and have it continue to function once you go to your music screen. You must either stay on the pedometer or stopwatch screen for their functions to work. However, if you had music playing prior to their usage, your music will continue to play. The FM radio will only work if you have earbuds connected to the 3.5mm audio jack. You won\'t be able to listen to the radio through bluetooth without an audio wire connected because the wire acts as an antenna. Cool add-on bonuses include the ability to record the broadcast you\'re listening to or even to record stand alone voice memos. Music playback is great. It\'ll take MP3, Flac, APE, WMA and Wav formats. I\'m pretty sure it\'ll take other audio formats but I didn\'t try them out. It\'ll also recognize LRC lyric files. You can set your own playlist or select from your existing playlists. You can also sort your music by artists, albums, genres. Pretty standard features. I could not test any videos, but I can tell you it won\'t play mkv files, since I had a few movies in MKV format on my card that weren\'t picked up. It will only play AMV video files. Overall, this is a jam-packed music player the had way more than I expected and far exceeded my expectations. It\'s like they thought of everything possible and tried to jam it into one device. You\'re getting a bargain for the price they\'re charging, because this is a an excellent value for the quality and features of the device.The good:Excellent battery - rated 55 hoursInternal speakerBluetooth pairingAlarmButton lockPedometerComprehensive manual in 5 languages16GB internal memory, expandable to 128GB Micro SD card (recognized my 200GB card)Recording Radio/Voice memosEbook readerVideo playbackFM radioThe could be better:Only 1 screen protector includedPedometer/Stopwatch won\'t allow multitaskingLED light up button brightness isn\'t adjustableVideo is limited to AMV video formatAlarm can\'t select a specific date</review><review> 'After hours of wading through product choices, customer reviews, features and considerations of my needs in comparison with the available options, the Soulcker Portable Audio Player by Reeko was the most outstanding option I could find on the whole of Amazon for its price, its features, and esteemed reviews of customers.I am very, very pleased with this purchase decision. Honestly, it has been a while since I have been this satisfied with any purchase. Kudos to the makers of Soulcker! This is a really fantastic portable audio player. No kidding.I\'ve owned at least 4 iPods, a generic portable player from overseas, and several other portable audio players over the last 20 years, but this one really bangs away at my own song, so-to-speak.  It starts by being an excellent value for the price. It continues with features that really satisfy. It sounds incredible, and I dare say the sound quality meets or exceeds that of iPods. And, one thing my iPods never had was their own built in speakers. I did not expect this player\'s speaker to be as loud as it is, but I was surprised to hear it playing outside my home\'s kitchen door while it was indoors on a countertop and I was standing at the closed doorway into the kitchen. Mind you, it\'s not going to wake your neighbors playing tunes from its own built-in speaker, but I was pleasantly surprised by my ready ability to hear it while it was playing indoors, and I was standing outdoors, with the door closed between the two of us. Wow!The battery life on this player has impressed me. It easily went about 50 hours.  Sweet!  I am so thrilled with this item, that I am glad to share my vote and offer an overall rating of 5 stars.Oh, now, wait, it isn\'t perfect, but the things which I might otherwise consider as flaws are miniscule issues that probably just require me to get used to because this is a bit different from the old players I\'ve owned. For example, one must press the power button to get the screen to wake while the device is still playing audio. To advance from the current playing song, when the screen is asleep, one must press the power button to wake the screen and then the forward button to advance the songs. One other less pleasing attribute is having to select the microSD card folder, since songs contained therein are not recognized as being in the players complete library. That is, those songs are treated as being somewhat different than song stored on the device, making it necessary to think of the device as having two libraries: one on the device itself and the other in a directory of folders containing the files on the microSD card. It\'s not ideal, as say one library incorporating songs from the device\'s built in memory along with those stored on the microSD card (not included, of course) but it\'s just as acceptable. Maybe the manufacturer can find a workaround for this in future productions.The arm band is well-constructed from neoprene, and it offers a hook and loop type closure in the form of a strap that incorporates a buckle. Let me establish here, however, if you have a bicep that is anything larger than the girth of an average wrist, do not expect to wear the armband around your biceps. My meager upper arm measures only 17 inches in circumference, but this arm band doesn\'t get close to fitting at all. It does, however, fit wrapped around my lower arm at the forearm level. Speaking of this, unless you plan to place the player with the screen side face down and facing your arm\'s skin, you will find that the volume of the speaker, even at the topmost setting is almost silenced by its placement with screen facing you and rear facing speaker directed to your forearm\'s flesh because the speaker is placed so that it directs sound from the back of the player. No worries, though, I won\'t be doing any jogging or running, so this is not that a deal breaker. Also, it can be cumbersome to actually press the power button when the player is inside the armband. Again, not a big issue for me, if only because my use does not necessitate the armband.I connected this to my Soundfreaq Bluetooth speaker system in my home without incident. I was surprised that even from 25 feet of open space, the player transmitted to the speaker without interruption, static, or other undesired problems. I also connected to the sound system in a late model Lexus RX250, and found that the quality of the sound was still outstanding, and I still had full control to advance songs from the sound system\'s command center onboard the vehicle (pressing forward on the device was unnecessary since I could use the vehicle\'s control buttons to do so).Please be aware that the seller\'s use of "etc." in the item\'s description under supported file types playable with this player should not be considered as meaning "all typical audio format files are supported." In fact, this would be quite incorrect. So far, I have played FLAC and mp3 files without incident, but those that are m4a files I transferred to the device do not play, and instead, will show a message on-screen each time that reads "File type is not supported." Again, I can live with this minor issue--I\'ll just convert the m4a files into mp3 files and be done with it. Problem resolved.I also loaded pictures onto the device by copying the files directly into the directory under photos. You can play these as a slide show if you\'d like, and you can even set the number of seconds to display each photo before one photo fades into the next. Sweet!I think it may only show the clock time using the 24 hour (military) format (i.e., :20:00, for example), but I have not gotten around to trying to figure this one out just yet.I have not tried the ebook reader application. Probably never will.Regarding the FM Radio app on this player, you will find that you must use a pair of (presumably) wired headphones in order to get radio stations in your immediacy since this acts as the player\'s radio antenna. Otherwise, you won\'t receive any broadcasting radio waves to play on your player or its built-in speaker. Again, not at all a deal breaker.The weight is heavier than I would have expected of most portable audio players, but it is not at all burdensome.  I suspect that this is largely due to metal housing and a battery that really impresses me with its longevity between charges.The screen\'s image quality is remarkably high, and I have nothing to complain about regarding photos I\'ve added as these appear thereupon.I may continue to add to this review as I continue to explore all the features on this device. If I discover anything that is not aligned with my expectations or anything that particularly knocks my socks off, I will come back and add it into my review at a future point.Really, though, this is an unbelievable value for the money. I could not be more pleased with this purchase, and I would gladly recommend this player to anyone who\'s in the market for a device of this type, particularly if their needs are like mine: an affordable player, quality sound, easy to use interface, built-in bluetooth and built-in speaker, color screen, metal housing, full color display, and standard other features like photos.As far as I am concerned, this is the BEST PORTABLE AUDIO PLAYER I could find under $50. I am delighted with it and more so than I have been with any product I\'ve bought in the electronics department in the last year or so. Sure, it has some things that could be improved, but this thing delivers where it counts the most.I recommend this as a suitable gift, a suitable player for general, everyday use, and for outstanding quality sound.  Feature rich, this one really bangs my drum! Awesome!'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RQYX5Z/ref=lp_16225009011_1_109_twi_col_ti_2/140-7804560-2532901?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605590386&amp;sr=1-109</link><review> \ 'These headphones really underwhelmed me. Were they really $200 at one point? If so that&#8217;s ridiculous. They are very light and the noise cancelling is very good for the price point and the design is good and they&#8217;re quite comfortable because of the light weight. But...The sound quality is awful. Music sounds muffled - like the highs are pulled back so things tend to not be articulated well with vocals, cymbals, anything that pops really from an instrumental side. They don&#8217;t sound like garbage but the sound quality is more in line with what I expect from a $30-$40 over ear headphone set. The buttons aren&#8217;t the best for access and in low light knowing L from R when putting these on is a major chore.I have a pair of Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2s that were $130 and sound quality is noticeably better across the spectrum and those have similar noise cancelling performance. Those are heavier but honestly they feel sturdier than these Sony 710s which feel like they&#8217;ll fall apart with one drop. If the sound quality was better and these had a touch more power I&#8217;d be really happy with them. But I&#8217;m just not there so I&#8217;m returning them and sticking with the BackBeat Pro 2 set.Sony should dump these and get better amplification and better equalization and offer app support. If they could do that I&#8217;d pay $20 more for that and be extremely happy. But this is unacceptable for the price. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a worse pair of headphones in this price range to be honest.</review><review> "As a woman, one of the irritating things we constantly have to deal with is people trying to talk to us while we jog, walk, or hike.  I find that sport earbuds and tiny headphones are not enough of a visual deterrent, so I went looking for something large and bulky to visually signify that I'm busy and do not want to be disturbed. (As if I should have to....)These Sony wireless headphones fit the bill in terms of visual size---and happily, the dark blue model is more easily visible against dark hair. In terms of noise reduction--they perform well for audio-book consumption, considering that my routes are along busy multi-lane roads in urban San Francisco. With my old sport headphones, the only way to hear while jogging through rush hour traffic was to crank the sound up, which ultimately damages your hearing. With these, I can have the sound at a more comfortable level.However, there is a major drawback. These over-ear headphones feel slightly tight and uncomfortable pressing against the ear, with mediocre padding. And I don't think I have a giant head or enormous ears. I think if you were to wear them for an extended period of time (maybe 4+ hours/day) you might develop hotspots. If you just use them for shorter duration events, such as phone calls, you'd probably be fine.The second drawback is that they don't come with a carrying case or protective sleeve even. That's fine for my daily exercise, but not ideal for travelers and commuters. But on the positive side, battery life is great, and you can comfortably go for a full week without needing a charge. However, I read some reviews that said the battery charges in mere minutes, but that's not true. It actually takes roughly 7 hours to fully charge, which is a long time when you forget to prep the night before.", "Pros: Just works! With anything! Stupid battery life, even after using them what felt like all weekend when I power them up it the lady that lives in the computer in it claims the battery is at 100%. I am not sure if these headphones actually run out of battery or not, that 35 hour listening thing is probably not a joke.I don't care for the band over the head, a softer plastic or even pad would have been nice there. It's sized appropriately for a grown-up's head and ears, which is a plus.It's noise cancellation is not total, however, it's pretty good.On sound quality - Seems to be by device. On my pretty new LG phone it's great, on my 6-year old PC's Bluetooth it's not very good for some reason. My friends on Discord tell me I sound great on the mic too.Bottom line if you aren't a audiophile or high-end tech fiend that just want to listen to your music or watch movies without waking up your significant other, these are probably excellent headphones that aren't too much money - Look around at what you can spend, I'll bet most normal humans won't find any benefit to spending three times as much.", "Bluetooth is a disaster:When I got my first order, and the bluetooth would disconnect during an online meeting (Microsoft Teams) i thought it was a problem with the one headset so I asked for a replacement. My second set has the same problem, BT works fine at the start of a meeting and within ten minutes, it starts dropping (when I realize  cant hear anything so Ive missed parts of the meeting discussion)Mike : over the past two weeks, my colleagues complain they cant hear me -I sound muffled, distant, in a tunnel ! my job involves leading workshops (online since C-19) That's why i bought the headset for $250. It wont work, even with the cable. It works for one call and then not for the next 3. Since its past 45 days, Amazon wont take it back. I spent an hour with Sony Customer Service (chat) and they finally said my headset has issues (as it wont go to factory reset) so asked me to mail to them and then wait for a new replacement. I wont have a headset for a days, while I wait (Amazon sent me my replacement first -even before I mailed the return) I will NEVER buy Sony accessories ever again.", 'Son ligeros, la bateria dura varios dias. La calidad del sonido es buena sin ser excepcional. La cancelacion de sonidos externos es buena tambien.

I'm doing a small project involving an 8x8 LED matrix and running a server on the ESP8266. There are lots of code examples on the internet. I have already successfully connected to my local wifi. It is nice that this comes with 3 boards even though I'm not using all of them because I'm a beginner and could potentially screw something up. Also, the cost is surprisingly low considering what these can do.Here are the steps I took to get this thing up and running:- Download and install Arduino IDE (running it on Mac OS Catalina)- Download and install the driver (Please see the back of the dev board which specifies the correct driver to download. Just Google search for it).- Download the ESP8266 board library- Plug in the ESP8266 via micro USB (this provides the 3v power required. No other power source needed).- Write code and compile/upload it via the Arduino IDE. Note: I ran into an issue where python3 was not found during compile time. I had to install it via homebrew and even then I was still having issues. I recommend googling troubleshooting steps if you have this issue. I eventually resolved the issue by adding something to my bash_profile.- The code you upload will instantly execute as soon as the upload is finished. Anything you place in setup() will run once before anything else runs. Anything in loop() will keep executing over and over after setup runs. This is the common pattern for Arduino boards.Recommendation: Get a breadboard and some jumper wires which makes it much easier to connect components to the ESP8266.", 'These 8266 12-5 Node-EMCU boards are a great buy for the price.  These allowed me to get a few IoT projects off the ground. As I get deeper into the project I am looking into switching to the V1 8266 boards as they are smaller and would probably be more then sufficient for this project.The Pros -These boards are easy to set up, configure, and get working for ESP-8266 projects.Easy to use, headers already installed.The Cons -The board seems with be missing a clear layout guide.  The top and bottom have different pin names.I was able to figure it out but a clearer pinout on the board would be helpful.Over all I would recommend these boards for anyone looking to get into Ardunio and or IoT projects that require wifi.</review><review> 'I have 11 of these units now. I have 6 of them running with DHT11 sensors and data logging to my linux server on a regular basis (every 10 mins). I have them all over my house and even one outside in my garden shed. I live on Vancouver Island and so far the lowest temperature record this winter is -2C. The boards are extremely reliable and I have only had to reset them on a very rare occasion.</review><review> 'I love these boards as they are suitable for so many projects.  Only issue I have is that on two of the three boards I received one side of the pins were soldered on an angle that make it next to impossible to seat properly on a breadboard or you risk breaking something.  I will have to try and heat them up to straighten them out.</review><review> "A neat little board that's nice to have a built-in voltage regulator so you can power it with 5V through USB and you don't need a UART adapter to flash the chip. Note that the available flash is on the lower end of the spectrum, at only 512K, and not the 4MB that is listed as the spec for the ESP-12E, but this should be good enough for most purposes. I've used one of the three boards I received so far to power a set of individually-addressable LED lights using the WLED library, and it's worked beautifully."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Laura-Ashley-Victoria-Duvet-Cover/dp/B010AL5FSU/ref=sr_1_896?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Home+bedding&amp;qid=1605596676&amp;s=kitchen-intl-ship&amp;sr=1-896</link><review> \ 'UPDATE: 2/26/17Oh, I am so disappointed that I had to come back and update my review.

I ordered a duvet, duvet cover, 3" pad and a new pillow in one sweep.This duvet is absolutely beautiful. Well made and so comfortable! Here in SC we have had bizarre weather- in the teens one night and in the 70\'s the next. I\'ve been pleasantly surprised at how well the duvet works for both.I love the pattern too! It goes with so much! Planning on getting the matching sheets next!</review><review> 'This duvet cover is so soft! I love it! But take note it is just a cover.

I love them because they are thin fit and just enough protection to them that I feel like my phone is safe. (and it makes iPhones much less slippery to grasp!)This is the same, but yet.. I have some qualms:1) It feels a little cheaper, and it is a full-around case that covers the bottom and top instead of just the corners.2) They covered up the buttons! I always LOVED that they did a cutout for the buttons as I hate button coverings. They missed big time with adding that - there is a cutout for the switch, the buttons should be. that way too.3) Minor niggle here but only coming in black stinks. I bought a blue phone and it would have been nice to have a blue case.Still overall decent case, just isn't. perfect anymore, and now I have to go look for perfection once more. And take an X-acto knife to those stupid button covers....", 'I happily ordered this case after finally upgrading to the 12 pro max from the 7 plus, and I was not disappointed.I can see why other people might be mad because the sides/lips do completely wrap around the phone, but with the new squared design of the iPhone 12... what did you really expect?The case itself is still pretty thin and still provides a much better grip on the phone.My only complaint is that I wish Spigen made this specific case in more colors, like perhaps a deep blue to match the blue of the phone, instead of ONLY black.</review><review> "Fits perfect and slim. Exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for something that wouldn't make the phone much bigger than it is. It is much easier to hold with the case on thanks to the grip it provides.

No matter how I scrub, I can't get any of the dirt off. Wish I could still return and get a different color.", 'I used to have this case on an iPhone 6S Plus, and I have to say, this new one for the iPhone 11 is demonstrably worse. The rubber grips are about the same, which I appreciate, but the hard plastic underneath it is much more slippery than the old model.It kind of defeats the purpose of having a "grip" case if the plastic parts of the case have zero friction. The other negative side effect of this is that it\'s nearly impossible to stand the phone up from its bottom, since the plastic around the charge port is incredibly slick and will slip on all surfaces.Also doesn\'t help that, as a guy with decently-sized hands, my thumb and middle finger naturally rest on the slippery plastic parts of the case, not the rubber grips.On the plus side, this case has protected my phone well from drops. On the other hand, not sure those drops would have happened were the plastic not so slippery.</review><review> "Not the thinnest of cases, but not much that bigger than the standard Apple cases for the iPhone 11. It fits in my shirt pocket at work and that's my personal criteria for maximum size of the phone with a strong protective case.  Had cases from Speck before and they lasted without showing much wear until upgrading to  a new phone (usually every 2 years). I like the case a lot. For my needs it's the best ratio between size and the protection it offers.", 'I bought this case for my iPhone 7plus. Had it for almost 3 years. It was still in good shape. Bought an iPhone 11.

Today (March 23, 2017), my label writer decided to stop working completely. For no reason! I had just printed several labels on it, but after trying to print the next, it simply won\'t connect to my Mac. I\'ve uninstalled the driver, reinstalled it, unplugged everything, replugged everything, restarted my computer -- all to no avail. After attempting to eject the label roll I was using from the printer, it turns out, my Dymo LabelWriter 4XL can\'t even do that! The only thing that seems to "work" on it are the lights, and that\'s it.I\'ve tried emailing Dymo, but their website gives me an error when I do this. I\'ve tried calling, but they aren\'t available. I spent a lot of money on this printer. I\'m really upset. :(When it DID work, it was a dream! It printed quickly, made my life easier -- I thought I was set. No more needing to buy ink cartridges, no more needing to tape paper labels to my packages -- I could just stick Dymo labels on with ease! But if this thing starts malfunctioning (like it has for several other users) just a few months later, what\'s the point?Please make this right, Dymo.</review><review> 'we bought this one after reading a lot of the other options. dymo is a great brand and has lots of custom options however canada post labels i cant figure out how to do and neither can my other fellow retail owners, pretty disappointed.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Touchscreen-Laptop-i7-10750H-XPS9500-7845SLV-PUS/dp/B0897WZSZ6/ref=lp_16225007011_1_1113/143-6520811-4877668?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594087&amp;sr=1-1113</link><review> \ 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0The laptop is gorgeous but beware of the touchpad as it wobbles and has like a false click when you\'re using it; this is by now a known issue and my unit was affected by it.

I did however prepare myself prior to opening up the box by watching videos/tutorials of what 1st timers should do prior to flight and they helped immensely. The different flight modes, such as beginner, will allow you to familiarize yourself with the controls until you get more comfortable. Things such as auto takeoff, landing, return to home and all the obstacle avoidance sensors greatly help until you get more flight time. There is also a pause button that once pressed acts as "emergency braking" and will stop the unit, even out of some automated flight modes, and just hover. It\'s up to the individual whether to spend $1,500.00 for your 1st drone but if you do this unit certainly has lots of precaution settings to help you along.</review><review> 'Let me tell you something, for a $1500 drone&#8230; Quality control is crap. If I thought this was a isolated incident... I would&#8217;ve sent it back and got a second, but reading the forums&#8230; This happens to too many people with some workarounds, unfortunately they didn&#8217;t work for me. Making me think that the controller was bad from the factory. Which, the second it disconnected, sent it off flying in random directions and had it crash once. The scary part was, there was no rhyme or reason. I would disconnect the cable on my phone reconnect it... then it would just connect seconds or minutes later.For a company who is touted as being one of the premier drone manufacturers, their quality control is just terrible. If the drone cost two or $300, I could forgive it. But when you were paying a premium price for a premium drone, you don&#8217;t expect amateur issues. Not to mention, I was lucky if I can get it to fly a half mile without video disconnect. No matter which way I turn the antennae&#8217;s  or where I flew it. Not to mention, the video quality even with the 1 inch sensor was worse than that of a half inch sensor at 4K... and considering that they had the forethought to put the 1 inch sensor on this drone, how is it that the older Evo has 60 frames per second but this drone does not? Then I also had an issue of getting statically lines in the video when I moved the drone forward. I have no clue what caused it, but it was obviously not only disconnecting from the remote, it was also getting interference from the main CPU to the video chip.So, instead of returning it and getting a second, which I didn&#8217;t know it would work or not. I decided to go with an Autel Evo. Which has been a dream do not only fly, but the video quality is second to none even at night. And was much a higher quality than the Mavic 2 Pro.What I found out after doing some research is that the Mavic in fact, does not use all of it sensor in the high-quality mode, therefore you aren&#8217;t getting the benefit of the 1 inch sensor to give you that extra light. Which is why the video quality at night looks so horrible.Yes, you can clean it up and post which I&#8217;m going to guess is what the decent looking videos from it do. But I wasn&#8217;t going to pay so much for a drone that basically required me to do surgery after the fact. Which the Evo does not. I can post videos directly from the drone and they look incredible, with very vibrant colors and sharp incredible imagery.Making me salivate over the prospect of the Evo 2 and it&#8217;s 8K/24w/ 48 Megapixel still camera and it&#8217;s 6K 1&#8221; camera, which are interchangeable. The cool thing about Autel... they are from Washington state, it&#8217;s a small company with 14 employees and you can call and talk to anyone of them that you want. Which means, fast, efficient American customer service. Not to mention, they listen to fans of their drones and implement features because of them.Evo 2 should be available in mid to the end of March &amp; I can&#8217;t wait!</review><review> 'Absolutely amazing piece of tech.

Originally opening it the back was scuffed which is fine since it is refurbished but upon further inspecting there was a chip out of the screen, massive scratches on it too, it was dead on arrival and you couldn&#8217;t even put the charger in it cause it wouldn&#8217;t stay. Oh and not to mention the home button was pushed inside the iPad itself.

Three months later one of them starts blinking, I used ITunes to reload the software and no joy.  I bought a third party program that said they can fix these issues and still no joy.  The only thing left is a hardware malfunction, if these are so poor quality that they can't last three months of normal use and I'm right out side the 90 day warranty.  I know you're looking at this listing thinking of saving the money but your odds of getting a very poor  refurbished IPad is very high. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.", "I love this iPad and use it everyday. I purchased it with the intention of using it for general web browsing, reading comics and drawing.I also purchased the Apple pencil and the combination of these two products has rekindled my desire to draw - a talent that has fallen by the wayside in the last ten years.For artistic purposes, many will want the larger sized iPad pro as it allows a larger canvas that fits the dimensions of traditional paper more closely. The trade off of course, is that this is more portable and can be held more comfortably. The smaller size for me personally was a good middle ground between using it for creative purposes and using it for idle entertainment.For reading comics this is amazing. It has excellent screen clarity and the colors are vibrant. When I zoom to individual cells of a comic, I don't noticed any pixelation or distortion. I have also used it for reading magazines and have no complaints at all with the quality of the experience (Amazon has a nice selection of magazines that are free to read with the basic prime subscription). I haven't tried to read an entire book on this, so I can't comment on whether that's possible without getting sore eyes. I will say that it is extremely handy for reading recipes and the portability of the device is great for use in the kitchen.Regarding the specifics of the actual refurbished device, I was extremely happy with the condition of the product which was like new. There were no scratches or defects of any kind. As others have mentioned, it comes with a third party charger, but this didn't bother me because I felt that the price point was reduced enough to comfortably make that concession.Every other mobile device I've owned has been an Android device. I haven't found the iOS ecosystem to be difficult to use. I will say that iOS is not as configurable or open as Android which is noticable. Certain preloaded apps that I would prefer to delete can't even be properly hidden, which is at times annoying. For this reason I couldn't see myself ever purchasing an iPhone, but for a tablet I can appreciate the charm of the operating system's simplicity and directness. A strong bonus of this as a supplement to my Android phone is that the iOS has apps that are specifically tailored to the app store and not available elsewhere, which is fun to discover.The responsiveness of this iPad is unreal. Apps open incredibly quickly and the home screens slide back and forth with no noticable delay. I have also used this to watch YouTube videos and tv shows and was happy with the video and audio quality.Some people have postured that this a replacement for laptops or traditional computers. I couldn't see this replacing a PC as a workstation, but perhaps I'm old school. It functions excellently doing things like writing on PDF files or reading documents. It is possible to adapt keyboard as well, but without a mouse I can't imagine it for computer based office work. The glory of the tablet for me is using it on the couch for general entertainment.The battery holds a long charge, but as a downside takes quite a while to charge. This can easily go a day on a single charge with normal use, but mobile gaming will wear the battery down quicker as you can imagine.Ultimately I am very satisfied with the product. I had contemplated purchasing a lower priced tablet, but in the end decided that I would treat myself to the tablet that most online reviews regard as the best. I don't regret it.", 'So far so good... came nicely packaged. Not in original but good. Looks mint. Obviously the charger is used but in good condition. Started it up and put a screen protector on right away, paired the Apple Pencil and updated the iOS. The thing I&#8217;m most happy about is that it has AppleCare until mid 2020. So that&#8217;s a bonus with it being renewed. It&#8217;s the first day and just only 1 hour since I unpacked it so.. So far so good &#128522; My bf got me this so I can use it for my art. The best gift ever!!I&#8217;ve now had for about 4 mths and just recently I noticed a bright spot above the home key. Shows more clearly on a white background. After research it seems these pros are notorious for this issue. I thought I could maybe live with it but it does get annoying. So seeing as I&#8217;m past the 90 day warranty with Amazon I was lucky enough to have AppleCare and I brought it in for a diagnostic test, sure enough it&#8217;s a display defect and they ordered a new one for me. If you don&#8217;t have the AppleCare out of warranty it&#8217;s a 449$ fix for this model. Unfortunately I have to downgrade my rating now from five stars. The problem with buying refurbished is that you don&#8217;t know if it will come with AppleCare. It&#8217;s a big risk. This common issue happens to new models as well though so it&#8217;s kind of hit and miss. And hopefully it doesn&#8217;t happen again with the replacement. We will see. I still love the iPad Pro!</review><review> 'Had bought a refurbished iPad pro recently and was like new. Decide to buy two more for the kids. This one arrived first.

Only apparent in white screens but nonetheless there and annoying and distracting.Doing was fast and well packaged but it will be going back</review><review> 'The iPad came in a generic box, packaged decently. As soon as I unwrapped the iPad I noticed a big dent right by the camera module. I inspected the rest of the iPad and noticed several chipped areas around the edges and bottom. The screen had a crack right below the fingerprint sensor. There were also generic accessories, which they stated may be the case. This wouldn\'t be a big deal if they were quality components. The cable was labeled Foxcon, and the shrouding over the lightning connector had already come off, leaving an exposed connector and dried glue. The included charger, had no labeling, but was only 2A output, so not even rated to match the original. Overall, not impressed. I didn\'t bother setting it up. It is immediately being sent back.I\'ve given it one more shot and ordered a replacement. But if this is how quality control is done at amazon, and what they consider "looks like new" then I\'m not expecting to be impressed the second time around.</review><review> 'Extremely pleased with this 10.5 - 256gb wifi  Apple Pro iPad.

They charge the fastest out of all of the chargers I have ever had. I have two 6 footers and one 10 footer of these. The 6, come with a cool case. Even though I do not use them, it was an awesome touch. It also comes with a nice Velcro strap to strap it together. BEST add on ever!I will buy these again and again and again. I highly recommend them to everyone and anyone!</review><review> 'I have bought a lot of Anker cables and plugs. Unfortunately two of the 2 metre cables have failed. However, Anker replaced them quickly. There is a serial number on every cable on a tiny silver strip which should not be removed. Giving the serial number, download of the order number and an explanation to the customer support email is all that is required. No need to post the broken ones back. Pretty impressive service.</review><review> 'These cables are the best cables at first because they charge well and easy to spot when you misplace them!I said at first above, because I&#8217;ve owned both this version and the version before but they have not lasted as long as their price or marketing suggests.I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve been extremely unlucky and had two bad batches of different versions but the ends of the cables (near the connectors) have both frayed after a few months of use. This means that it&#8217;s charging and data connection has become unreliable and intermittent so it has to go in the bin.</review><review> 'I have always loved anker products and Owned several Powerline II for almost a year now. Never had issues with them and they still are going strong and sturdy. I decided to upgrade with the Powerline+ II as my daily driver.

Now its very inconsistent as charging turns on and off again randomly. This is not what I expected from Anker as I bought them depending on their quality and reliability.***UPDATE****They reached out to me after my review and have sent me a replacement cable and the new cable works perfectly fine and as what is expected from Anker. This builds my trust in their company even more and they definitely have my loyalty to their brand. Would 10/10 recommend these.</review><review> 'I&#8217;m delighted with my two charging cables , Apple cables covering had perished and split, so I was on the hunt for a replacement. As the old cables were a tad short for my needs I thought I could do with a longer one . These cables are brill, long, well made . Only had them a short time so can&#8217;t comment on their longevity. The up side is they come with a semi rigid zipped pouch, and a velcro loop , so you can curl the cable up fasten it with the velcro and and have the ends as long as you need , in a neat little package . As for chargability , I can&#8217;t see any difference in the time it takes to charge devices , it may be even a little faster.

This was bought for my 5 year old but the entire family from age 5-55 enjoyed playing with this little guy. Charge time between play is about 15/20 mins and it runs roughly 7/10 mins, works exactly as described and seems to have a personality even . We were impressed with its ability to sense walls and other objects to avoid crashing. We were further impressed by its durability when crashing , it is very light weight and impact is very light and falling doesn&#8217;t harm it at all even from great heights.

It is *extremely* slippery, though. The Jasbon cases have a nice, grippy yet smooth silicone feel. This is much more slick feeling, and would fly out of the hand easily. With a pop socket or phone loop this issue would be very minimal, and the slick texture on the back would allow for excellent adhesion of a pop socket.

It will provide fantastic speeds and will be a nice upgrade for older routers not capable of keeping up with the increasing internet speeds provided today by most ISPs.Unfortunately, Netgear decided to dramatically change the internal components and then still sell it under the same name (R6700). With that said, Amazon has a little product alert indicating either R6700 or R6700v2. Well, they are shipping the R6700v2 which does not match some of the specifications shown on this page (in particular the CPU speed).I know because after receiving a router that did not match, they offered to replace it and send the first version of the router (the one with the higher clock speeds as indicated on the actual product details) and ended up receiving the same thing (another V2).I will say that for those interested in a router that will not be flashed with custom software or that will not use other more advanced functions a router can provide, this is no problem. For those of us that know the hardware and know what we are expecting, that is a problem.I have it a 3 star because any company that makes an original version with better specs and then turns around and significantly changes this without changing the model number and making minor modifications on the box (see amazon's own photos - both boxes are pictured) simply does not deserve my trust. Speaking of ratings, many of the ratings you see here are lumped up with other Netgear products and also apply to the original more capable version.I encourage you do your research and check reviews from different sources.

These would have been five stars but the one I got has the left and right channels backwards. Someone at the factory must have put the color rings on incorrectly. Not a problem really, just run the balance controls from one side to the other when you hook them up and switch if they are backwards. Otherwise high quality heavy shielding and insulation, the plastic welds are solid and the connectors are hefty and tight. A big improvement in sound quality over the skinny cable I had.</review><review> "A good basic/general cable by all accounts - does what it says on the tin, albeit with no frills, and has generally good quality connectors on each end. However there is one aspect of the cable which could use some improvement and which accounts for my low rating - the 3.5mm plug has a metal lip with an increased radius just before transitioning to the plastic section and this section meant that the plug wouldn't quite engage fully on an HP Stream laptop. Because of this, I only ended up with the right-hand channel and nothing in the left, as the plug needed to be a fraction further in. Wouldn't recommend for any devices with a slanted outer profile or any kind of recess around the headphone socket."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Salon-1875W-Titanium-Dryer/dp/B07TS94FLB/ref=lp_16225006011_1_2426/140-2571538-0352049?s=beauty-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605595395&amp;sr=1-2426#customerReviews</link><review> \ 'I bought this because I needed a diffuser attachment and I lost the one that came with my current blow dryer.

The table is also portable and easy to set-up. If I wanted to get up the table slides very easy back and forth.

But then I saw this adapter, that could conceivably be used to connect either of my monitors to my iMac via thunderbolt. And it cost what a single one of those cables would have! So for me, it was a no brainier.The cable seems well made, sturdy and elegant. It comes with gold plated terminals. It connects easily and snugly to either VGA or HDMI cables, which means I can now use my iMac with either type of monitor, and it works beautifully with my Mac, from the second I plugged it in, wihout a single hiccup so far. I have only owned this adapter for only a few days, but I think it's pretty much perfect. It's kind of a shame that it doesn't do 4K, but frankly, I don't see myself spending big bucks on a 4K display any time soon, so this is not a huge deal for me.

I chose not to buy a docking station so this was the perfect alternative since it allows for the HDMI or VGA.Sound does work with the HDMI port (as it should).Generally speaking I've used it on other computers as well with no problems so I'd be surprised if anyone has problems with a device that has a mini display port.", "I have a Surface Book, which I'm now using as my desktop after my old desktop unit suddenly died.  Since the Book has only 2 USB ports, I also bought the docking station that has four additional USB ports, but uses one of the USB ports on the Surface.

I needed the other USB ports for my keyboard, another monitor, my mouse and an external storage device.  I decided to try this device before investing in a new monitor.

I\'d always used whatever stand the monitor came with until my brother talked me into picking up a mount. It\'s made a world of difference.I\'m 6\'4" tall, and as such, have never had a monitor that could adjust high enough for optimal viewing. This mount changed all that, and more. Not only am I able to position my monitor higher up, bringing my eyes in line with the middle of the screen, but I\'m also able to position my monitor closer to my face for better immersion in single-player games. When I switch to something competitive, I\'m able to push the monitor back so that I\'m better able to see the whole screen. That flexibility alone was worth the price of entry.Assembly and adjustments were easy with this mount, and it includes all necessary tools. I had it attached to my monitor and my desk in less than ten minutes. I went with the c clamp mount, but may ultimately drill a hole in the desk.Materials seem really solid. There\'s some flex in the plastic cable management bits, but that\'s by design. It makes it easier to route the cables themselves.Adjusting the various hinge points in the mount was very simple, although it took a bit of tinkering to dial it in for my 27" monitor. It feels like it\'s on the heavier side, but this mount can apparently handle a lot more. If I dial the tension higher, the mount will spring half-way up even under all that weight.The real test with a product for me is whether I\'d recommend it to a friend. I wouldn\'t even hesitate to recommend this desk mount. It\'s great, and the added flexibility in monitor positioning adds a lot to the PC gaming experience.</review><review> "Pros-Holds 2 monitors-Adjustment range lets you position them any way you want-Includes C-clamp and conversion parts to use with a pre-cut hole-After tightening, everything feels sturdy-Adjustable tension on the arms-Easy Assembly-Includes cable management clipCons-None yet (will update if anything comes up)ThoughtsSo I've got my two monitors set up.

At first, I tried the anchor in the center, and it was way too close, felt like my eyeballs were melting. After the offset, everything is perfectly and firmly in place. Assembly was a breeze, took all of 20 minutes, and that was mostly finding where I wanted everything. There were no missing parts and the only thing you may need is a philips head screwdriver to attach the brackets to your monitors. Everything else is done with the included alan keys. So far, everything's perfect.

The wall protecting plastic bar is made of poor material in which the bolts easily stripped the plastic when trying to even loosely tighten it.

I&#8217;m not a pro or a lifelong gamer.I&#8217;m a dude that plays SW battlefront 2 till 3 am.I don&#8217;t want crazy insane sound, I just want to play and talk without disturbing my neighbors. (Condo scenario).So I needed a headset. Looked online and saw that these were in budget and pretty cool looking.So I got em.Setup was cake, wasn&#8217;t really sure how they&#8217;d light up, but whatever. I&#8217;m in my den alone. No one would see em.Turns out there&#8217;s a usb connected to the 3.5 that operates the lights. Ugh. If gaming on a PC or a Mac, cool. No probs. But as an Xbox One player there&#8217;s no way to (easily) make them light up.But now the important part.The mic works great. My friends can hear me no problem. Nice and clear.The headset, when connected to the Xbox controller, releases a sonic panorama I really wasn&#8217;t expecting.Blaster bolts panning from ear to ear, no problem. Light saber sound in relationship to position, perfect.Stormtroopers creeping up on you, not so fast guys. I can hear it.So one star off for the goofy dongle wiand the fact that you look like you&#8217;re gonna land a 747 when you wear em&#8217; (see pic). Four stars for fantastic bass response, great 3D sound quality and overall build.</review><review> 'The build quality is great. Sound quality is pretty good too.The USB cable is only for lighting up the leds on the headset! Not for audio, just a heads up!The box came with a splitter cable in case your gaming PC or laptop has mic and speaker input/output split. So this was nice.One issue I had was that on my head it does not fit quite right. Because the ear cups do not swivel, the bottom of the ear pieces does not remain flush with my ears because of the shape of my head. So there is not a good seal against my ears. This does lower the bass sensations a bit. Other than that, everything was great.I did make a few calls with this headset using my phone and call quality was great. The person on the other end always told me that I sounded clear. So mic works well.For the price point this is a nice sounding and great looking headset. Especially for the price point!</review><review> "I really like these. They sound great, they're comfortable. They look and FEEL sturdy, like they're meant to weather some serious gaming moments they'll never forget. I'm hearing impaired and it's hard for me to find a decent headset that can be loud enough and retain sound quality. These seem to do just that and bonus for me is that the earpieces/foam/whatever is large enough for me to wear OVER my hearing aid. First time for me. Oh and the mic is a mic. It does it's job, yet it's not meant to record albums on. All in all, I'm happy.", 'Yes, I have a small head AND I wear glasses.  Yes, this headset is comfortable for hours. I searched for weeks for a headset with good reviews for glasses wearers and small-headed people and found these. I regret nothing! I do wish the mic turned 360-degrees so I could have it on the right side of my face, but I\'ll survive. I use these for my laptop and Xbox, both with ease--plug and play.For clarification, my small head is about a half inch smaller than the smallest setting on these. Maybe the same size as a kid with a bigger head, I\'d guess. Circumference means nothing and I"m not entirely sure how to measure the whole dome because I think my neck might be in the way.Hope I helped inform you!</review><review> "They're great", 'I just got it in the mail and it came after only 5 days even though it came from America (i live in Australia). It\'s nice and large which is fantastic as I have quite large ears, it\'s also has quite a good sound quality that rivals the "premium brands".There are not many negatives but all I would say is that the mic isn\'t removable but that\'s about it and I knew that so I wasn\'t lied to either.All in all the headphones are worth your money and are far cheaper and probably better than the premium brands.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Cooler-Adjustable/dp/B01469DJLM/ref=lp_16225009011_1_2558/134-2666606-4516352?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605591219&amp;sr=1-2558#customerReviews</link><review> \ "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0Best Cooling Pad for my MSI GE72 17.5' laptop.

Iv attatched a video comparison between this cooling pad and the targus chill mat + which was $50EDIT: Already broke less than 1 month with it... very disappointing. the fan in the center still works but the top right fan makes a terrible screeching sound. was very happy with this product on the first day but 1 month isnt long enough for something like this to break..", "Nifty cooler. It adjusts as the picture shows and has little stoppers to prevent the laptop from slipping off.

Finding any type of accessory for this laptop is a bit of a task, and I was skeptical about ordering this cooling pad because I haven\'t had too many good experiences with cooling pads and laptops in the past. However, I definitely needed one for my new laptop and someone else said this fit their large laptop comfortably, and another one said that their daughter uses it just fine in the comfort of her bed (which is what I also do, so I needed something that wouldn\'t be awful on my legs or on the rumbled blankets) and honestly, I\'m very impressed!The lights aren\'t bright at all, or distracting. There are TWO sets of fans you can use- the big middle one, or the four mini ones. You can use one, or the other, or both at the same time, or neither if you so choose. There\'s no way to deactivate the lights apart from the fans but thankfully none of that bothers me. It\'s not horribly loud either, and the angle is adjustable and it has two little catchers on the front that aren\'t invasive or annoying at all!This is honestly one of the best products I\'ve received from Amazon. I highly recommend this for larger laptops.</review><review> 'Be aware I ordered this product as I liked the idea of been able to run 3 different variations of fan, main large single fan in the centre, the 4 outer fans or all of them with the button switches shown in the advert pictures.

Without the USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, it will perform pretty much like the T5.I have tested on my 2019 Surface Laptop 3 with USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 support. I was able to get the full speed from the best, and also copying files to it.  Seems to be very fast!! But!!!  As the file gets larger, the speed/performance started to decrease.  This is not noticeable if the file size is smaller than 1gb, but once the file gets larger then 1gb, the larger they get, the worse the performance gets.  I have also tested the T7 on my 2014 Macbook Pro, with USB 3.0.  The speed test shows that its about the same speed as the T5.Bottom line, When transferring smaller files, the T7 is super fast!!! As file size gets bigger, especially lager than 1gb files, you will start to see some performance/speed decrease.  Since I do a lot of video editing, and files can be huge, this can be a problem for me.  I think I will wait to upgrade to the newer T7 drives.

My experience is similar to the experiences others have had with this product. Specifically, SSD causes computers to over heat. The SSD also gets extremely hot! The issue does not correlate to i/o or computational load. The issue occurs the moment the SSD is attached to the computer. Interestingly, the Samsung T5 does not have these problems. It is my conjecture that the T7 is simply an overclocked T5. If my suspicions are true Samsung is engaging in very shady business practices.  Please do your self a huge favor and avoid the T7 as it will ruin your hardware.</review><review> 'This thing cost me a week of my life.If you are thinking of getting this instead of the T5 then think again.As mentioned in other reviews below, this SSD overheats, it causes the CPU usage to go insane, it constantly disconnects for no reason.I called Samsung support, the guy had no clue how to troubleshoot the issue.I ordered a replacement on Amazon, spent another day with the replacement, exact same issue.My Ravpower SSD And the T5 run perfectly with no disconnects and normal cpu usage.</review><review> 'DON&#8217;T BUY!

The tablet arrived quickly and was shipped with one day shipping. The reason I purchased the tablet was because my grandson is autistic I didn't want to replace an $1,100 Chromebook in case it got broken. This tablet with all its accessories was it very very good buy and it's not going to be a hardship to be replaced in case it gets broken. In addition it comes with a lifetime warranty which should last about two years.When I opened  the box I found the tablet ( which was charged nearly  to 100%) felt very very substantial, I found a wireless mouse that takes 2 AAA batteries( which were not included), a stylus, a rechargeable Bluetooth( also fully charged) a flip cover case, a cloth for cleaning the screen ( which is not really worth much cuz it's very and thin) and a protective film screen protector. In addition to those accessories it came with a micro USB to USB C adapter, and USB C cable, a wall wart for putting each one of the cables into and it came with a micro USB cable as well. The tablet itself has a USB C connector for charging and the Bluetooth keyboard charges with the micro USB cable. The only thing that could have been better is if a second wall wart would have been included to charge the Bluetooth keyboard the same time the tablet is charging. But that's a very minor concern as I can just plug it into the USB on my computer or I can plug it into my USB Hub because we have multiple wireless devices in the house.When I ordered the tablet I also purchased a tempered glass screen protector and 128 GB memory card because I was using this for my grandson's schooling. I did have some issues figuring out where to put the memory card but I figured it out and the tablet recognized it quickly I installed the screen protector as well and I took the tablet and all its accessories to the school for the kickoff conference with his teacher.I did not realize that the tablet had an 8-core processor I thought it was just a quad core. That was a very nice surprise. The fact that it has 4GB of RAM and 64 gigabytes of memory on the tablet itself is awesome. While we were setting up the tablet including his Google Classroom his school email etcetera, we found the tablet responded very quickly, and connected to the Wi-Fi for his school very . Overall this is a very good device for him to use for remote learning, and we'll be able to handle any apps or tasks that the school gives to him without the frustration of a subpar tablet.All-in-all I am very confident in my purchase and feel that this was a very good Buy and that it will handle everything he needs this year for school. In the future I will look for this brand when I need to upgrade his device.Note: I did this review on my personal tablet with voice to text so anything that seems a little out of place is because Google can sometimes be dumb when it comes to translating spoken word to text and I didn't have the energy to repeat the same word 80,000 times. This issue does not reflect on the tablet but on Google itself."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Lightning-JSAUX-Certified-Headphones-Compatible/dp/B0895WTVGZ/ref=lp_16225009011_1_7344_cpbg/140-2465021-8334206?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592884&amp;sr=1-7344</link><review> \ 'Good connector for my iPhone to the car.

The first time I got them, I struggled through one installation. However, since this is a pack of two, I managed to get the second one on without any problems. It lasted for a long time until I dropped my iPad. While of course my heart sank when I saw the cracked screen, I quickly realized the protector had done it\'s job. The protector was cracked, not the actual screen. Quickly I peeled it off and went to Amazon to buy another. It arrived promptly. I recommend installing in a well lit room and dusting the surface of the table before beginning. That being said, it\'s very hard to see if there is dust on the screen so it might be prudent to use the little dust remover stickers to make sure you get the dust. This time I managed to get the screen on in one shot, having the second as a spare now in case I break this one later.The only real reason I\'m giving this a four star review instead of a five is that the package clearly says to use the "guiding stickers" to make sure you put the screen on there without getting it crooked. However, I searched high and low and could not find them. I remember using them when I previously purchased this product, but clearly they were not in this package. I was able to eyeball it well enough so it wasn\'t crooked, but I was still annoyed that I didn\'t have those stickers to help.Overall, great protection, great deal.

I bought a replacement and find that it no longer works with Windows 10.  Apparently, one of the recent updates to Windows 10 isn\'t compatible with the Lifecams.  It simply won\'t install.  Windows doesn\'t recognize the device at all.  There\' a lot of agitated chatter about it on the Microsoft support forum but no one has a solution.  The only good news is that I found a little manual focus Ausdom webcam that performs just as well as the lifecam and it\'s less than half the price.  Way to go, Microsoft.  Your own lifecam product isn\'t compatible with your own operating system.  You have to wonder how those folks at Microsoft feel about themselves.  There\'s no effort there at all to compensate the customers whose cameras no longer work and no solution in sight.  Those support folks are so incredibly helpless all the time that I\'m sure most of them are in therapy or heavy drinkers or something.**EDIT**  Couple Microsoft updates to Windows 10 later and now the Lifecam installs and runs again.  However, the $25 Ausdom manual focus webcam still out performs it in every way.  The Lifecam "autofocuses" itself into semi blurry status every day and it\'s focus has to be manually reset in the camera controls screen of it\'s software and switched to "Auto" off. Yes, every day.  Pain in the butt.  So the el cheapo webcam at 1/4 it\'s price is still a better choice.  Better picture.  Less hassle. Way cheaper.</review><review> "I bought this to replace a logitech camera, and I wasn't sure what to expect here, as the reviews are all over the map... but it's a solid camera, and I feel it beats my old logitech 920 in terms of low light performance and possibly back light situations, but of course that is subjective.The quality and performance exceed the price paid, and it works 100% with Windows 10 no hassle.", 'Windows 10 stopped supporting my old webcam. I was a little pissed but the LifeCam VX-1000 was pretty old (but it was Microsoft). I like the replacement LifeCam Studio. Going from VGA resolution to Full HD (1920X1080) is nice. The instructions (pictures) were not that clear and the pointer to the website at the beginning was misleading. There was no software or drivers on the website just PDF copies of the documents that came with the webcam.I guess the best thing to do is to ignore the instructions. With my Windows 10 computer connected to the Internet, I just plugged in the webcam and the drivers downloaded automatically. A couple of the drivers seem to be related to facial recognition. It looks like the webcam automatically focuses on what it recognizes as the subject\'s face.The webcam works with the "Camera" app that is built into Windows 10. It works with other apps, too because apparently this is a UVC standard webcam. There are no controls on the webcam except for a button that you set in software to snap a picture or a burst of pictures or start/stop video and stuff like that. There is a light on the button that comes on when the computer accesses the webcam. "Manual" focusing is done through software. I can get it to focus from a couple of inches to infinity.I found drivers for the VX-1000 after buying this webcam. It looks like Microsoft wrote drivers for my old webcam after I gave up on it. Go figure.</review><review> "Tried hooking this up to a 2017 MacBook Pro. Gets detected immediately and works fine as far as communicating with Hipchat/Webex/Hangouts/Photo Booth/etc and audio is concerned. Unfortunately even in a moderately lit room, the picture is washed out to the point of being unusable, and there's seemingly no way to control or adjust it. The only thing that kinda worked for me is to point it directly at a light source when turning it on, as it seems to calibrate based on whatever it is looking at when it first connects. Starting with a bright light makes the picture appear almost normal when you reposition it normally. But doing this for each call is more of a hassle than repositioning my laptop in order to use the built-in webcam, which is what I bought this to avoid needing to do.", "I have had my old webcam camera for a long time; the old one was much cheaper, but there was less stuff on offer then. The old one itself replaced a really old one. Necnology has move on again and this is much better. I am old now and will not need to update my webcam again; I've made three goodbye videos which can be played after I have past away, if anyone wants to look at them.", "I bought this camera after returning a Microsoft HD 3000 that was horrible in my hands. This one was 48 pounds (the other was 19) but ten times better. The image is very sharp, the dynamic range really good and the sound quality superb. Moreover it is a true HD device. I am very happy with this purchase and I would buy it again. Let's hope it does not stop working in a few months. Finally, I would like to say that I was also considering the Logitech C920 but I bought this one because it was much cheaper. However, the Logitech is also a great camera, maybe even better than this one according to the people."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Ethernet-Internet-Snagless-Connectors-Router-Black/dp/B06XXH72SZ/ref=lp_16225009011_1_1333/142-7781764-4313114?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605590802&amp;sr=1-1333</link><review> \ "Good cable.

And that is normal for these headphones! I can look past the buggy software issues and the strange on off button (that only sometimes works) but for a newly released set of $150 headphones to not work while charging, is insane to me. How annoying to find out you can\'t play a video game with your friends because you have to let your headset charge?Even worse, what happens when I\'m on a work call and they die or the battery gets low? I just don\'t speak until they are charged? I would love to know what the prod. team who developed these has to say about this "feature".I\'ll try to briefly summarize the other issues that I could have gotten over.1) The headsets max volume is not very loud. I had my PC audio all the way up, and the headset audio all the way up, and it still seemed about normal.2) The initial software install is buggy.3) I could not figure out the audio jack to save my life. When plugged in, I could hear static, but the power on the headset would turn off. I tried everything/troubleshooted for like an hour and could not get it to work.4)The headphones are on a strange vertical slant. Normal headphones are pretty much straight up and down, but these are tilted forward for some reason.5) They are uncomfortable (Mostly due to reason number 4)I could have gotten past the list of issues above by lying to myself that the price was worth it because it gets the job done, however this is too much. I am shocked that other people gave these a positive review.TLDR ; Headphone\'s don\'t work while charging, and that is not a software error or bug.</review><review> "Where do I start?!The distance/range of these things won't even go downstairs with me without connecting.The audio isn't loud enough.Can't use while charging.Very disappointed with this purchase."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-Bodygroomer-BG1026-60/dp/B010XIGBUQ/ref=lp_16225006011_1_1144/132-7389970-1017647?s=beauty-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594947&amp;sr=1-1144#customerReviews</link><review> \ 'This is a great body groomer-- I can\'t post pictures of wonderful effects of this product, but I\'ve included a PG rated  "before and after" picture</review><review> "Female user here.

Personally, I primarily use it for more crafty or household repair type work, but I think it would work fantastic to seal food or bottles when traveling. We recently used it to temporarily plug a very small and slow leak in a pipe under our bathroom sink until it could be officially fixed, and it worked amazing!

I absolutely love it. I hope my video review is helpful to you!~ :)EDIT: I noticed a lot of people forget... please make sure you're PLUGGING the cable ALL THE WAY IN! ^_^", 'This headset has a lot of goods going for itself, especially at this price point - decent sounding headphones, detachable cables and mic, solid build quality, and extremely comfortable even with my extra large head. I was left disappointed, however, when it came to use with PS4 despite it sounding fine on PC. When I connected it to my PS4 controller I was treated to a set of headphones that was too quiet. After doing some research I found out this headset has an impedance rating of 65 ohms, and that the PS4 controller does not have enough power to drive the thing. Whose problem is it to fix, Sony or HyperX? Regardless, while this is a great headset, it does not work well enough out of the box with a PS4 like the product description claims.</review><review> "I am using Fedora 31 Linux. Overall the headset is great - lightweight, comfy ear pads and very good sound quality. I found the 7.1 surround sound to be brilliant. The bass controls on the headphones do make a difference (I noticed others said they did not), but I admit it's not a massive difference.If I use the headset just via the mini-jack, then it all works (no surround sound of course). In particular the mic works fine. (I had to make one minor change to Fedora to reduce the otherwise large amount of hiss when recording.) The sound quality as stereo headphones, is again great.If I use the headset via the USB connector, then the surround sound, and other controls, work, but the mic does not. For some reason it is seen (using 'lsusb -v'), but not available for use (via system settings, alsamixer, pavucontrol etc). This was really disappointing, but I cannot honestly say that it is the headset at fault, maybe something in Linux is just not quite enabling the mic.I was going to return the headset, but decided to keep it. I looked at other makes/models, but to be honest I could not find anything that provided so much. I'll simply use the jack when I need to use the mic, and use USB at other times. Not ideal (hence 4 stars), but good enough for me."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Spotlight-Camera-continuously-Charger/dp/B07L8XNMTK/ref=lp_16225009011_1_7402/131-3369044-4730546?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592910&amp;sr=1-7402#customerReviews</link><review> \ "These solar panels for my Ring stick-up cameras with batteries were the lowest pricd by far of all similar products.

Great customer service.The panels were ridiculously easy to install, each taking about 5 minutes or so. I'm a 68 year old lady with three broken toes in a cast boot, climbing up a ladder to do this, and it was still easy.At the time of installation, the batteries were charged to 82% but after about three or four hours of sunlight, they charged to 100% and have remained fully charged.I highly recommend this product and the seller.

The cable in my picture on the left is the cable end of my original order - a one piece molder connector, while the one on the right is the end of the cable on the new charger. Why has the end changed, with the instructions still saying you have to insure you screw them in tightly in order to make sure they are weatherproof? I guess I will see how long these last. Wish I could respond to questions I ask on products directly as I posted the question on their amazon page and got a response that the screw in portion is part of the actual Ring light, while I do appreciate the response, it isn't correct as I just received another Ring light that does not have, nor list the screw in connector as part of the kit. Even the manufacturer video on here shows that the end of the cable is supposed to be the T shaped screw in connector.  I'll adjust my review up or down as soon as I've had them long enough to see if they allow in water as my cameras are, obviously, outside. I assume if they changed the connector they are either proven to be water-resistant without the screw or that they will cover the cost of a new Ring camera. Have a great day!", 'We have 4 Ring wireless cameras and 3 of them have Wasserstein solar panels and one has the Ring panel.  The Wasserstein ones are just as good as the OEM panels with the added advantages of having a more flexible mounting system and being cheaper.The build quality is on a par with the Ring ones and as I said, the mount allows you to angle them more easily.  I would not hesitate to recommend these over the Ring variant.All of our cameras have 2 batteries in so we didn&#8217;t have to charge them so regularly.  We now have no need to charge them.  Over the Winter only 2 of the cameras had panels, and neither needed the batteries charged.Are you going to save money in charging costs, yes but it will take until 2120 to get your money back.  However, you will never again find yourself outside in the pouring rain changing batteries as always seemed to be the case for me.</review><review> 'The main solar panel unit is of excellent quality and value for money, as two solar panels are in the box.  However, the two black screws provided to secure the solar lead to the back of the ring  stick up camera are far too small. The two screws need to be longer to allow the lead to fasten to the camera securely, this is the reason for the three stars.

Plenty of sites for that kind of measurement. I'm going to tell you, being a 20 year IT professional, this is a solid processor. I replaced a Xeon E3-1225 with this processor. Even coming from a Xeon for productivity and virtualization, this is a solid upgrade. My system is stable, performs faster, programs execute faster, and my VMs within my labs operate far more efficiently and provide the fast operation requires for a IT professional. If you are considering the 10600, then this is worth the consideration if you're in the productivity space. If you're in the overclock gaming space, then, no, this processor isn't the best option out there. However, it is reasonably priced, has some good mainboard support options, and I even ported over my RAM from my 4+ year old Xeon system without any problems.So, this is not the MOST economic processor. However, its relatively economic, stable, has good hardware support options, and provides a solid improvement over prior generation Intel products. Point is, if you're looking to buy a solid CPU, this is a good bet.If you're looking to overclock the thing into a lava pit in your tower, just go elsewhere and don't give negative reviews when YOU are the one out of spec.", "Not the best value out there, but I think it's still a very solid buy if you want it ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY for gaming as I do.About the price, 182 I think it's O.K. Anything more than that it's unacceptable considering the competition.My current CPU is the i5 4670K so, as you can imagine, words cannot describe how much I'm looking forward for my new MoBo to arrive so I can finally complete the upgrade!!Saw some benchmarks and I was very happy with them.Would recommend to anyone buying a new CPU just for gaming and to paired it with a z490 MB. So down the line you actually have an upgrade path as newer GPUs become available.", "This CPU is definitely an upgrade from the quad core i7-4770 (non-K) that I previously had! Glad to see the i5 now has hyperthreading, thanks to AMD. But, I may have gotten the worst performing 10400, as my Cinebench R20 and R15 scores are noticeably lower than the benchmarks you'd see online (both single core and multi core and I've got all my drivers/bios installed and up to date). Regardless, I'm very happy with this purchase as this CPU is no slouch. Currently have it paired with an Asus Prime B460-Plus and a Zotac GTX 1070. Be aware that there's two versions of the i5-10400. One has G1 stepping (pure 6 core chip and no STIM) and the other has Q0 stepping (10 core chip with 4 cores disabled, uses the newer thermal interface and shares the similar heat spreader from the higher-end unlocked SKUs). Though, the two should perform very similarly.Update 9/9/20: Went to the previous generation platform and currently using an i9-9900K. 10th generation ain't too bad, but it's best to wait on 11th generation Rocket Lake. It's rumored to use a 14nm backport of WIllow Cove... or just wait on Zen 3. For now, I'm waiting to upgrade my 1070 to the new RTX 3080 when it becomes available at my local Best Buy.", "Purchased this CPU to get a new system up and running while I wait for the 10900k that I have on back-order. For a relatively inexpensive temporary solution, this isn't a bad processor. It's certainly better than I anticipated.Oh, and, yeah, that's an aquarium the computer is sitting in. It's going to be filled with cooling liquid this weekend after I get the radiator and pump mounted.", 'This was an all-around great CPU even for video editing despite the lack of course the hyper-threading I think really helped out quite a bit</review><review> 'Notably faster than the i7-6700 it replaced plus two more cores for six cores total. Good price. Excellent for someone who does day-to-day stuff on their PC and work mainly in Microsoft Office and other basic apps plus games. Obviously, if you\'re doing lots of video encoding or apps that benefit from multithreaded tasks, a Ryzen might give you better value for your money. But this is faster in gaming than the Ryzen 3600 and even beats it in some "productivity benchmarks" so it was the best processor for my use case: MS office, video conferencing, very light video editing and GAMES. Not overclockable, but that\'s fine. You can still use fast memory on a z490 motherboard and get notable gains in performance. Low 65w TDP means it runs very cool and can maintain max turbo till the cows come home.</review><review> 'Muy bueno</review><review> 'Awesome 6 core and 12 threat processor</review><review> 'The included graphic card is more than adequate for photo processing using Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.

There was a lot of weird noises that sounded like I recorded the session under water.  Since sound was a big part of my grade, I decided to order a microphone with noise canceling capability and this had the best price with the options I was looking for.  I used it for the last 2 sessions and was really impressed, especially with the noise cancellation.

I found this one and figured I would give it a try. I am glad I did. I could not see myself getting one of the high end mics that are advertised, but for around $30 what did I have to lose? It arrived faster than expected, so that was a nice start. When I opened the box, I was impressed with the packing. It was encased in a foam like material to protect it rather than just loose in a plastic bag like some other product. I plugged it into a USB port and it just worked! You need to make sure the mute button is not on, but that is easy to see because of the LED on the top of the mic. I played around with levels in the sound settings control panel, but it worked fine on the default settings. I tested it by recording a video and comparing it to the camera mic. The sound quality from this mic is clear and plenty loud. I can place this on my desk and it picks up both my wife and I when we are in front of the camera. I took a chance on this USB mic and I am glad I did.</review><review> "This is easy to use and picks up well.

It&#8217;s really cute but the case is super hard to remove from the phone. I think I scratched my phone and my fingers hurt a lot from trying to remove it. It&#8217;s almost impossible. Also, people can&#8217;t hear very well when I talk to them because of the case. And if you&#8217;re listening to an iMessage voice note you could only hear  it with your ear in the phone, not on speaker, because the case makes the iPhone think that your ear is pressed against the phone already.I think it&#8217;s too much hassle so I&#8217;m getting an other case.

I am very happy with all of it!!!</review><review> 'Fair condition, okay condition, but EXTREMELY difficult to pry apart ... and that\'s an UNDERSTATEMENT indeed, as it was ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to pry apart. And it almost required throwing the case up to GOD in the sky to pry it open! That\'s how EXTREMELY difficult it was to get the soft plastic to BUDGE off the hard pieces!. After trying so many, many, many times &#8230; and wracking my mental abilities to the point of almost literally losing my mind &#8230; and after being so extremely frustrated that I was psychologically "freaking out" &#8230; Well, finally the thought of trying a rounded-edge tool used to eat with, a kitchen table knife, came to mind as a possible means by which to get the soft plastic pried off the hard plastic pieces. And bingo! The soft plastic finally began to BUDGE, but to get the soft plastic to BUDGE the full entire way in order to get it completely pried off the hard plastic pieces was STILL challenging, as it seems the soft plastic STILL wanted to be resistant to prying off completely! What a WEIRD experience! Never knew it would be that EXTREMELY difficult to get the iPhone case completely separated! I would have expected that the iPhone case would have pulled apart as easily as it shows it on the diagram. It shows the soft plastic as if it\'s easily just coming apart, no problem. That picture should be replaced with a picture of someone STRUGGLING and STRUGGLING to get the plastic piece separated, to the point of EXHAUSTION! Anyway, as far as the actual product that was sent, after FINALLY getting the soft plastic piece separated, I\'d give it at least a "fair condition" &#8230; or even an upgrade from "fair" condition to "pretty good" condition &#8230; or possibly even an upgrade from "pretty good" condition to beyond that. It depends on someone\'s definition of "fair" condition, or "pretty good" condition, or whatever. Of course, a person has to be reasonable in expectations, as it\'s a "used" product. So I cannot expect that everything will be completely perfect since it\'s a "used" product. One edge seems a little bit worn or whatever, but that\'s to be expected. Although, I wasn\'t expecting to see a couple of tiny, itsy-bitsy sparkles on my clothing; but that could\'ve been due to a couple of tiny, itsy-bitsy sparkles that got on the outside of the phone case during manufacturing regardless of the fact that the phone case is used. Because even used items can still retain little, itsy-bitsy sparkles on the outside from the manufacturing plant, especially since soft plastic tends to retain little, tiny particles that stick to it due to soft plastic having a "sticking-ness" to it. I cannot think of anywhere else that the sparkles would have come from, but someone else likely would not have even noticed those ultra-tiny, almost-invisible specks. I just happen to be perfection-oriented, detail-oriented enough to notice things that other people might not have the foggiest clue about unless someone pointed out such microscopic-ism. However, so far I think I\'ve only noticed those microscopic, little "beauties" on that one single time. And there\'s also the possibility that those almost-invisible sparkles just happened to come from the one slightly-worn edge; but as long as such tiny, itsy-bitsy "beauties" aren\'t manifesting furthermore, let\'s just assume they were still clinging to the outer surface of the phone case upon exiting the manufacturing plant even after original use. I\'d like to give this a 5-star, due to the phone case being in pretty good condition, except for the expected slightly-worn edge, which is to be expected of a used item, so it cannot be expected to be in absolutely perfect condition. However, due to the EXTREME difficulty of trying to pry the soft plastic off the hard plastic pieces &#8230; and "freaking out" as a result, to the point of almost losing my mind or something. since it refused to BUDGE not matter how much mental faculties I put into use and no matter how many times I tried  &#8230; I thusly gave it a 4-star &#8230; It wasn\'t necessarily the seller\'s fault that the soft plastic stuck so UTTERLY-IMPOSSIBLE-TO-PRY-APART.</review><review> 'It&#8217;s so cute!!!

I tried using it for indoor photography with a Speedlite (flash), but the ISO levels were much higher than I felt comfortable with due to the f/4 limitation.  It was also considerably bulkier than my 24-70 f/2.8; especially, with the tripod mount attached to the lens.  Finally, the minimum focal distance was pretty terrible.  I could get considerably closer to my subject with my 24-70 vs the 70-200, thus I shot the 24-70 almost all the time.  After hearing rave reviews about the Tamron, and the ability to do Macro(ish) photography, I purchased the Tamron and placed the two head to head.SharpnessI didn\'t do much pixel peeping, but it seemed to me in the center of the frame, both the Sony and Tamron were sharp.  The Sony fell apart in the corners pretty badly wide open.  The Tamron definitely was sharper in the corners wide open (even at a full stop faster), but certainly not as sharp as the center of the frame.BrightnessAperture-wise the Tamron is a full stop faster than the Sony (f/2.8 vs f/4), but it actually seemed to pull in 1.25-1.5 stops of light.  That is, in some situations where the Sony shot at ISO 800 at f/4, the Tamron seemed to be around ISO 300 at f/2.8 vs the expected ISO 400.  Not too surprising since the Transmission of the Lens is different than the Aperture.  It just might be that the Sony has more lens elements and coatings that reduce light versus the Tamron.  To any effect, it was a nice little bonus.Minimum Focus DistanceIn autofocus mode, the Tamron can definitely get closer to a subject than the Sony, but reproduction ratio is still not as good as my Sony 24-70 f/2.8.  Switching the Tamron to manual mode and setting the Zoom ring to 70mm you can get as close as 1:2 which is getting close to Macro territory.  The center sharpness seems quite good at this setting, but it does get quite soft as is moves to the edges of the frame.  This is the only time that I missed having the manual focus ring on the end of the lens as I found it hard to hold the camera and lens steady with my hand placed so close to the camera body.  It\'s neat you get that bonus feature out of the lens, but those that want quality Macro images should still get a dedicated Macro lens.Low-Light PerformanceThe Tamron seemed to get an additional 1-1.5 stops of light over my Sony depending on the focal length, but the Sony has lens Optical Image Stabilization built in.  With the Optical Image Stabilization turned ON, I was able to get (reliably) an additional 1-1.5 stops out of the shutter speed, so for still subjects, it ended up being a wash.  On the other hand, for moving subjects, the Tamron has the advantage as you can have faster shutter speeds with better Iso performance over the Sony.Indoor Photography with SpeedliteEven with a Speedlite, I find larger apertures to be preferred.  The larger the aperture, the brighter the background is which make for more pleasing, natural looking photos.  The Tamron created more pleasing images, at faster shutter speeds (or better ISO performance) than the Sony.Build QualityReviewers lamented at Tamron\'s plastic housing calling it cheap and "kit lens" like.  In my experience, nothing could be further from the truth.  Yes, the housing is plastic, not metal, but the zoom and manual focus rings have a nice, smooth feel to them.  In addition, while not terribly heavy, there is some heft to the Tamron lens and it feels solid.  Finally, there is a nice tactile feel of the (huge) rubber Zoom Ring and Manual Focus ring.  I will say that the Sony feels like a tank with its metal housing and internal zoom, but the Tamron is no "kit lens", it feels substantial in the hand and I personally like the black finish to the Sony\'s white.To be honest, after testing both lenses, I was conflicted if I really wanted to get rid of my Sony.  Tamron seemed to only slightly edge out the Sony in all of my tests.  But the deal-breaker was when I used the Tamron out in the field.  It takes up less space in my bag and feels so much better in the hand than my Sony ever did.  The fast aperture meant that I could pump up my shutter speed to freeze action or eek out better ISO performance.  Where as with the Sony, I would shoot a little bit and then switch back to my 24-70, the Tamron I just enjoyed shooting so much that I would keep it on for much of the day.  Needless to say, I sold off my Sony and kept the Tamron.</review><review> "I wanted to buy long zoom lens for my sony for a long time now. Sony 70-200/f2.8 was expensive and heavy for me. So I was thinking about buying 70-200/f4, but when I saw first reviews showing sharpness of this Tamron I decided to wait. I that was  a right choice.With first images I was surprised with how sharp this lens is. It is also not much bigger than Tamron 28-75 that I also own (significantly heavier though, but that's to be expected). It doesn't have optical stabilization, which is good to have on telephoto lenses (in-body stabilization works better on smaller focal distances), but for the price and its versatility I expect it to be on my sony body a significant amount of time.And with the same 67mm filter diameter I don't have to buy new set of filters.Tamron wins my heart and my money once again!Update:after a few days I've noticed a sound as if something was loose inside the lens when shaken a bit. After some research I now know that its focusing mechanism that moves freely when camera is powered off (or lens is detached). This is due to this lens using electromagnetic coils to move focusing mechanism as oppose to servo motors. I would still recommend this lens as this doesn't affect picture quality or experience, but I wish they would come up with some solution to fix all moving parts when camera turns off.", 'L&#233;gere, magnifique piqu&#233;.Rapport qualit&#233; prix exceptionnel'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/HP-Chromebook-14-Inch-Celeron-14a-na0020nr/dp/B08529BZSQ/ref=lp_16225009011_1_363/134-7960009-5224942?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605590475&amp;sr=1-363</link><review> \ "I gave this product 4 stars because now that its finally connected to wifi its quite nice.

As a temporary measure I put an 8 port switch up there and used a bunch of individual PoE injectors.  The purchase of the TL-SG1016PE is meant to replace all of that, and act as a more permanent solution.Build QualityThe TL-SG1016PE is standard fare when it comes to SOHO networking products.  It\'s in a metal housing that seems durable enough.  The unit it 1U in height, and includes flanges to mount into a 19" rack.  The case has hexagonal perforations for ventilation, along with 40mm fans.  Thankfully, the power supply is internal, and the power hookup is a standard C13 jack.  A straight C13 cable is included.Setup/PerformanceI bought a cheap 4U 19" bracket to mount to a stud in the attic, but it\'s one of the shallow wiring type brackets for punchdowns.  The TL-SG1016PE\'s mounting brackets support the switch being mounted vertically (where the flanges are rotated 90 degrees).  I mounted the switch in the lowest U position, and a punchdown block will go in the top position.  The fit is good, and there were no surprises.  I think this is a really good mounting option for newer homes that have structured wiring coming back to a closet (usually a master bedroom closet), as it can significantly reduce the practical space/footprint consumed.The PoE ports of the device work fine, but it\'s worth noting that the total power budget of the device is 110W.  While I will not end up using anywhere near this, it\'s still good for you to know that the limitation exists.  This switch supports 802.3at-2009, which can max out the power budget at 4 devices (even though there are 8 ports).  For reference, the 5 cameras that I have on the switch consume about 24W total (and that\'s at night when the IR consumes more power).  When I have the full complement of 8 cameras on the device, I still won\'t be anywhere near the power budget.There isn\'t much to the setup of the hardware portion of the switch, but that still leaves the configuration of the "smart" management of the switch.  While the TL-SG1016PE is not a full L2/L3 managed switch, it does have some limited extra functions.  In order to access the switch, you can use a TP-Link software application to set the IP address of the switch - it\'s included on CD, but you can use the one you have installed already if you have any other TP-Link switched already.  I prefer to assign static addresses, but DHCP is available, too.  Once you\'ve assigned the IP, you can access the web management interface.  While I was able to log in with Microsoft Edge, I wasn\'t able to change the device password unless I used Chrome; Edge seemed to work for all other functions.The first thing I did was change the device password.  I then created a link aggregation group (LAG) for the two lines that I\'d run to the attic, which creates a higher bandwidth connection back to a switch (or computer) on the other end, provided that the other end supports it as well.  The last thing I did was to create a VLAN for the cameras, which I think is a smart idea for anyone that has externally mounted cameras.  Some of my cameras are mounted high up on the house, but others are low enough that someone could access the ethernet cabling with a stepladder... if they do, the VLAN limits the LAN access that the person would have.The web management includes PoE configuration and usage details.  You can set a switch-wide power limit, as well as per-port power policy.  I just left everything at auto.  The usage details are comprehensive, displaying exactly what the negotiated power level was, along with the instantaneous usage.Something worth noting is that the TL-SG1016PE, like the switch I was using before it, will be operating in environmental conditions that are out of spec for the unit.  The switch has an operating temperature limit of 40C, and the attic routinely gets hotter than that.  The robust cooling of the unit, along with the relatively low power draw I will have (compared to the 110W max), should give me at least a few good years of operation.  I\'d consider that to be a great result.ConclusionThere are a few things I would change about the TL-SG1016PE:1. It would be nice if the unit shipped with the current firmware (it doesn\'t).  There are a couple notable differences between the 5/18 firmware and the 5/17 firmware that ships on the device.  I recommend loading the new one ASAP2. I would prefer foam filters on the vents.  This is not something that most people wouldn\'t want or need, but I\'ve got my unit in an attic...3. It would be nice if the unit (which uses temp-controlled fans, I think) would have hall-effect RPM monitoring of the 40mm fans, and could notify the admin of fan failure4. It would be nice if there was some syslog or SNMP supportOk, so that\'s out of the way... none of the items above are absolutely necessary.  As it is, the TL-SG1016PE is performing flawlessly.  The VLAN and LAG are functioning correctly, and the PoE hasn\'t had any faults with my cameras.  I highly recommend this item.</review><review> 'Petit switch sympathique en version 4 HW.

It completely exceeded my expectations in quality, design, color, and price. The amount of pockets and space that this backpack gives me is amazing!! I needed a new backpack that would hold my laptop, textbooks, binders, etc for nursing school and this was beyond perfect! Especially since I&#8217;m only 5&#8217;2 and most backpacks ride low and make my shoulders slouch forward when it&#8217;s heavy but this backpack sits perfectly on my spine and I don&#8217;t slouch. There is so much padding on the straps, back, and inside for the laptops that I feel comfortable and my laptop is properly supported. The side pockets fit my huge water bottles and they don&#8217;t fall out of the pockets like it did with my last backpack (HUGE PLUS). I can even fit my 40oz hydro flask in the side pockets! The phone charger connection works (that is my own white portable charger) and I was charging my phone on the backpack while taking photos.

I switched from a very nice messenger bag to a backpack when I realized that my thirty-something body could no longer comfortably handle lugging around my work materials, lunch, and other junk to and from the office on my commute that often involves public transportation.  Besides, I'm in tech and a lot of my peers have been using backpacks for ages anyway, so it's not weird to be a grown adult wearing one. Right?I really enjoy the following about this backpack:- It's not basic black- It has pockets a-plenty- It comfortably fits my slim notebook laptop- It's water-resistant. The weather generally stinks where I live and this is a legit concern when it comes to toting nice bags.- So many pockets- It's lightweight- I can fit my lunch bag inside without it bulging precariously like my messenger bag did- Seriously, there are a ton of pockets", "Loving this backpack!

The cameras have an awesome picture and pretty decent battery life. The motion detection is almost too good...even when turned down it will turn on when insects fly nearby or when the wind blows strongly. The night vision also works well. The app is the major downfall of this system. I get push notifications when my cameras are triggered maybe 25% of the time and the app frequently logs me out automatically. This has result in me logging into the app to find 15+ events the cameras have recorded without a single notification sent to me. In addition, changing camera settings in the app is difficult. I&#8217;ll lower the camera sensitivity to 60 and the next day check it and the setting will be back to 80.

On the new model, you have to delete all old messages or none.  With the old model, if there was one that perhaps included a phone number, you could delete others but keep that one.  Can't do that on this one - it's all or nothing.

Yeah...woof.Don't buy! Get something better designed, where they actually got some user feedback before manufacturing.Also, fingerprint reader is too narrow for the thickness of the case, I feel like I'm shoving my finger through a tube to unlock the phone, that's what I get for having fat fingers lolUpdate 8/31/20: I realized that (with this case) it's impossible to swipe down on the fingerprint scanner - like I do at least 20 times a day.  There's a ridge on the top-side of the hole for the fingerprint scanner which makes this impossible.  Renders the case unusable.  See updated image 2.", "I got my new case today, and overall, it's great. It's pretty (the red is bright without being obnoxious, and the blue my husband got is darker than I anticipated but a gorgeous color), and I love that it has covers for the power/volume buttons, which makes me feel a bit more secure for those. One of the best things is the sloped fingerprint hole. It makes it VERY easy to find where to put your finger for the reader -- much easier than without it, actually.My big issue is that I have tried two pop sockets with it. The first I took off the phone before I put the case on. When that came off, I thought maybe it was just because it wasn't brand-new. But I opened a new pop socket (from the actual name brand), and it still came off after just a few minutes of use. I don't want to add other glue or anything to it because I don't want to damage it or the case and I want to be able to switch it out etc, so I think I'm just going to have to look around for a different case. A pop socket for me is a must because my hands are small enough that it is just easier to hold the phone comfortably while playing games. That's unfortunate because I love the case!If you don't need/use a pop socket, I highly recommend this case, though, especially for the money.", "Overall, I love the look of this case, and the fit on the phone is tight.

I am now actually amazed at how well they work for that low cost. Not sure I will be rolling the dice and using them on stage anytime soon, but for band practice and home practice and even possibly recording, these beat the crap out of a 25ft cord.  I will also note as others have, that these are a tad on the delicate side and I highly doubt they will take even minor abuse. The overall design functions great, but the plastic body could be upgraded to a high impact material of some sort and make a slight price increase worth it. FOR SURE, if you have high-end internal electronic parts, like a really tight jack - BE CAREFUL! You need to be VERY attentive to how you insert, and especially remove these due to their delicate nature.  As for range, I can walk away maybe about to the edge of a medium size auditorium venue stage. Any further may be pushing it. Call it around 25 to 35ft?  As for the sound quality, and I am a NUT about my tone, I swear, I think it actually got better. And I use expensive guitar cables.  So that was shocking.Battery life - Well...I gave that part 3 stars because the transmitter needs an upgrade in that area. It, as it should I guess, lasts about 1/2 as long as the receiver. At least my set does. All in all the transmitter will get me about 3 hrs of play which is fine. But it makes sense to me that they should have made that battery larger so they both die out around the same time.  ALSO, not sure if the batteries are even replaceable.First one of these I ever tried outside of my professional BOSS wireless system. And if it lasts a year or two, well worth it for the low cost. If for no other reason than I don't have to hazard my expensive system for practice.UPDATE: As of this week, the transmitting unit (Black) died. You can only hear sound coming through them when you tap on the body of the black unit.  Unfortunate, I really liked these for home use. I may have to upgrade this time. Oh well.  They were definitely worth the 40 bucks for the use I got out of them.", "Five in our band. Our guitar player had one already which got us all into gong wireless.

I immediately lost confidence in it, and with the other band members waiting i quickly resorted to a lead. The guy with two his started to play up, and he went back to leads too. The two guitarists seemed to last playing guitar in every song. The bass player was ok with his different one. Various combinations of us have had issues and as a result are rapidly loosing confidence in them. We are gigging every weekend and a couple more here and there up till Christmas. We need reliable confident performing gear. We are getting frustrated with them and pissed off every time someone crackles or is repairing them up.

Although, an Apple charger cable is not part of this product, being able to use my factory Apple charging cable helps the watch to be charged at optimum speed.One drawback is some of my heavy cases don&#8217;t stay well on the surface and it slides down. Also, you need to get your own charger. It comes with the cable with USB-C on one end that connects to the dock.</review><review> 'I&#8217;ll start off by saying that when I first got it, I tried using a small Apple cube adapter to connect to the outlet. This caused my watch to not charge continuously and my AirPods Pro would also stop charging. When I contacted support, they replied in a few hours with the recommendation to buy the QC 3.0 adapter that they mention in the product images of the product page. I looked it up on Amazon and found the exact one from the photos, for pretty cheap. When I got it today, I tried it and everything works as it should! It&#8217;s a little inconvenient that you have to buy the adapter separately but if you already have a stronger adapter laying around you can probably skip this step.I like the small profile of this charging station. I used it to replace my big bulky iHome alarm clock that took up a lot of space on the nightstand. This charges my AirPod Pro earbuds and case even with the silicone cover around the case. Charges my Apple Watch 4 without an issue and the 11 Pro Max. All three can charge at the same time without any issues whatsoever. The non-slip material on the phone pad is great! Phone stays in place, you need to be a little careful taking your phone off the pad just to be sure you don&#8217;t take the station with you. The pad is very grippy but, I&#8217;d rather it be like that than my phone falling off all the time!While it might not have a clock like my iHome, when the watch is charging in landscape mode, just lightly tapping the charging station (even at the farthest point from the watch dock) the watch lights up with the time and date. The tilted dock and bottom lip for the watch is sufficient to hold my watch in place for proper charging! I have a 44mm size watch.Tap a little harder anywhere on the charging station and your AirPods case battery indicator light will light up for a second or two with the current charging status (amber for charging, green for charged).Side notes:At first I thought the charging pad for the AirPods was defective because the indicator light would turn off after about two seconds. But what I had forgotten is that the light on the case is supposed to turns off but, it is still charging. If you put the case too low on the pad or too far off to the one side, it will not charge and you might see the flashing indicator light turn on and off and on and off again. The placement doesn&#8217;t have to be precise but just make sure it&#8217;s charging before you leave it.Secondly - when you want to check the battery percentage of your wireless AirPods case on your iPhones battery widget, there must be at least one AirPod in the case in order to transmit that data to your phone via Bluetooth. The percentage will show in the battery widget for a while but will disappear after a few seconds when the case is closed and placed on the charging pad. When I checked to make sure it was working, I took the case (with an AirPod in it) off of the charging pad and opened it. Sure enough, after a few minutes of charging, the case percentage had increased as it should have!Hope this info helps and saves you some frustration! Well worth the money.</review><review> 'Doesn&#8217;t work well on Apple watches. It says it charges it 100%, but then my watch doesn&#8217;t stay charged more than half a day when I use the cord plugged into this. Also important to note you cannot use the wireless charging pad if you have a Pop Socket or ring on your phone. Can see the appeal for people who would want to use this for their phone, but the watch needs to be plugged in separately.Definitely great for travel and to keep an area wire-free/clutter-free.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Android-Tablets-Storage-Bluetooth-Touchscreen/dp/B083BGRNMZ/ref=lp_16225007011_1_667/140-5930864-2425208?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605593928&amp;sr=1-667#customerReviews</link><review> \ "I'm using this tablet as a backup to my computer, as well as for the convenience of having a smaller mobile device.

So nice to have a simple setup as it is all the person I gave it to really needed anyway. Came with 100% charged battery and was easy and quick to get running. Nice screen and decent battery life. Everything is saved in the cloud and only plan on using it on WiFi at home, however it does have a memory expansion and sim card slots. If this had 4/64GB memory and came with a case, I would have given it 5 stars. Also, the silver version has blush color plastic detailing that looks very feminine.", 'Had a kindle for years. Thought I&#8217;d go bigger and more advanced. Glad I chose the zonco, we&#8217;ll worth the price. The touch screen is exact and the screen clarity is super crisp. This unit holds the battery charge better than I expected.I already recommended this to my daughter.</review><review> 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0I bought this device for my son, so far he loves it. Actually, this tablet has great screen quality, it came with a screen protector which I was surprise to see. It&#8217;s easy to touch, no freezing.

I also tried a micro-plane designed to shave off dead rough foot calluses and skin.  It was a step in the right direction and did OK to remove the offending rough skin, but it was labor intensive (maybe because I am just hesitant to shave off my own skin in a very strenuous and forceful manner) and took me a long time.  It made a small mess, too.  Then I saw this product mentioned in Reader's Digest in a blurb about how to take care of your feet, so I bought some and tried it.  Wow!  It works!  After applying AmLactin Foot Repair Foot Cream Therapy to my feet twice a day for a week my feet were smoother than they have been for ages and the dead skin was gone.  After I treated my feet, I asked my Podiatrist about his opinion of AmLactin Foot Repair Foot Cream Therapy and he told me it is good stuff, that it actually dissolves dead skin and does not affect live skin.  My Doc said there is a stronger strength version available that is prescription only.  My Doc told me my formerly dry, cracked, ugly, rough, sock-snagging heels looked fine.

Still works like the first day I had it. The plastic protector is still holding up and the pen still works perfectly fine!! Just wanted to give an update that this is still a GREAT tablet to get if you don\'t have the money for the newest Huion or a Wacom.If you dont want to read my novel of a review below here\'s the quick version of my review for this tablet. I thoroughly enjoy using this tablet. It does exactly what I want and I didn\'t have to pay hundreds of dollars for it. If you are a student, hobbyist, or professional who wants to draw/3D model/whatever else with a tablet, I definitely recommend this. As someone who uses a Intuos 4 at work, this is definitely comparable, if not better than the Intuos, mostly because of the price and it works flawlessly with Windows latest update.**Pros / Cons of Product:**+ Price+ Size overall and size of drawing surface is perfect+ Came with drawing surface protector that was extremely easy to apply+ With drawing surface protector on, doesn\'t feel rough and no scratches after heavy use+ Has pen holder and 8 pen nibs+ Pen pressure levels+ No recharging the pen (as other Huion tablets you do have to)+ Works with latest Windows Update and Windows Ink can be disabled+ Can customize orientation of tablet and disable buttons in the software+ Simple to set up software- Tablet and pen feel really lightweight, wouldn\'t want to put much weight on the pen for fear of it breaking- Can\'t save button configurations for multiple applications- Pen loosely stands in pen stand I will be updating the longer I use this product, but I believe this tablet works extremely well for me, and hope others will find my review pretty thorough so they can decide whether they\'d like this product as well.:)I use a Wacom Intuos tablet at work 40+ hours a week for the past 5 years doing 3D modeling and texturing. Never been able to think the price of a Wacom was worth getting one for myself at home. I began researching alternative brands and ran into the Huion website. Found the products to be extremely affordable and the reviews I read on their products on other sites (Amazon, Reddit, art forums) were always well and were comparable to Wacom. Decided to take the dive and buy this new H610 Pro V2 tablet, mostly because you don\'t have to recharge the pen (unlike the other Huion tablets), and the size fit on my desk at home. I typically become skeptical of smaller brands with oddly affordable prices, but I decided the price was worth a shot at least try it. After using it for a week, here is what I\'ve found about the tablet.** Extensive Review**I do have to admit, when I first unboxed the tablet I immediately thought of this: "Wow this is extremely light." I\'m not sure what materials are used for this, but it is definitely a lighter-weighted plastic than the Wacoms. Even the pen feels kind of light and empty, like even the thought of sitting on it could break it. It\'s not an extremely bad note just something that I immediately noticed.The pen is comfortable to hold and the buttons work extremely well. I have small hands and I actively use the nib and two side buttons for work and browsing the web and haven\'t found anything unusual about the pen. There is no eraser button at the top end of the pen, but I wouldn\'t have used it anyway even if it was there. Extremely responsive and fits my hands well and I actually like how light weight it is. It does feel a bit loose standing in the pen holder, but it\'s not that big of a deal to me. Also comes with 8 extra pen nibs in the pen holder and its great you don\'t have to charge this pen, its battery-less. When I\'d doodle in Photoshop, it never stuttered or lagged and was extremely responsive to pressure and button presses.The entire tablet size is about 9.5" x 14". The drawing surface is a full 6.5" x 10". As you can see in the pictures I attached, whatever is made to look like the drawing surface, is the actual drawing size. It\'s not a subsection of drawing surface like the Wacoms. You can draw to the entire edge of that drawing surface, it even gives you some leeway and recognizes if you go over the drawing surface and onto the tablet surface. You are however able to customize the size of the drawing surface in the software if you feel thats too much drawing space for you.There are soft touch buttons on the drawing surface, but I don\'t ever use those and intentionally covered them with the drawing surface protector that Huion provided with the product. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of the soft buttons before I attached the protector, which by the way was extremely easy to attach and the texture of it is great and not extremely noisy or rough. It has firmly stuck to the surface and I dont notice it when I\'m actively drawing. You can see in a pic I have it lifted so you can see the actual surface. There are also buttons on the side of the tablet with some pretty cute icons. I don\'t really use the buttons because I work in a 3D program called Maya, I have to use keyboard shortcuts more than premade buttons on the tablet. So unfortunately won\'t be able to say much more about that.Now I am going to tell you the selling point which really pushed the tablet to be 5 stars.... it WORKS PERFECTLY WELL WITH THE LATEST UPDATE OF WINDOWS AND WINDOWS INK!!! I have had problems with the Wacom tablet at work to work on the latest update of Windows and Windows Ink. I thought it was on my end, but upon researching found that a lot of people have been having the same issues since one of Windows recent updates. Those issues make it impossible to work on Windows right now, but here I am... able to work with this Huion tablet. Thank you thank you thank you to the Huion employees who was able to figure out how to get the tablet to be functional again with Windows. I can DRAG internet browser windows, I can RIGHT CLICK in internet/desktop browser, there is no lag when I right click anywhere, it works perfectly well and I\'m actually able to work..Also, the software used to set up the tablet is extremely simple to set up and I\'m able to customize how I set up my tablet. Example, I have my computer tower on my right side, and the tablet has the USB cord on the left side. At first I thought I was going to have an ugly wire run across my desk, but I found I can turn the tablet 180 degrees and tell the software thats how I have it, and it works! I can turn off any and all buttons on the tablet and pen, I can have the tablet work on only one screen or both, can turn off Windows Ink, have it screen ratio\'d to my monitor set up, or even make a custom drawing area. It would be nice if you can make changes to the button set up according to what program you have open, but I\'m just happy it works for me in general.</review><review> "So I just got this tablet today, unboxed it and checked it out.. light weight? pretty comparable to other electronic devices and there accessories it felt fine. I installed the driver and attached the USB cable and tried it out in blender and no pressure sensitivity.. looked around online and there isn't much info on this. after looking around for a bit I uninstalled the drivers rebooted to make sure I had no other applications open then reinstalled drivers and opened blender again and it worked, so far I've used this in Krita, Photoshop 2017 and Blender and Hell's yes very pleased with my purchase. In response to the bad reviews... really?I'm happy with my product.------------------------------------------------------------------Update to my review.After using this product for a few days in various programs. Photoshop, Krita, Blender 8.0 (Grease Pencil). The issues that I had were not related to the tablet&#8217;s, hardware, firmware or software. There was no software Cd with drivers that came with the product, but instruction for downloading them from Huion's website which I'm fine with. The first driver install was problematic and the device didn't function properly because I had a graphics application open during the installation, there are clear instruction to close all application&#8217;s before installing driver's. I uninstalled Huion&#8217;s software, rebooted my computer, opened nothing and then reinstalled the driver's and everything worked as advertised, and the tablet is fully customizable via there software interface.My system.. My system is an MSI laptop with I7 2.8 MGH 16gb of ram and a 6 gig NVIDIA graphics card. any Issues I had with lag were software issues  specific to the application used and not hardware related. Graphics programs are resource intensive and put a load on your system if you don't have the resources available or resources properly allocated to said software you will have problems working with larger files tablet or no tablet.Line quality? It took a minute to get used to using a tablet and figure out what was a hardware issue vs software vs user error. the pen is very sensitive and will show every mistake, In blenders Grease Pencil I used auto smoothing to compensate for my shaky hand and it worked great and felt natural like I was sketching on paper and it became a non issue. I didn't find an adjustable auto smooth in my version of Photoshop but from what I understand the latest version does have it, Krita crashed a few times and has known issues with open GL that was broken after a Microsoft update, that made figuring things out a bit buggy but once that was resolved I found that I was able to use there setting&#8217;s to set up auto smooth and improve line quality there as well. I think a good base for sorting out issues and what I did was unbox the product set everything up as directed by Huion then use Microsoft Ink to test the tablet and pen and resolve issues so you know whats what if its the hardware or system or software, and then move on to the applications that your going to use the tablet with.one last thing on line quality, another thing I realized was sketching on a letter sized document at 72 or even 100 dpi with a 10px brush is going to be problematic and look horrible vs a 10000 X 7000 px document at 300 dpi where I have more pixels to represent the line the image quality and line quality is going to be far better and print better with the larger document size, of course adjust the numbers to work with your systems resources and whats practical for you.The cons?  Directed at Huion regarding the design of the pen.. you give me two switches on the pen that I cant find with my fingers, make there profile higher so there in the way enough to figure out where my fingers are on the pen, two flat spots on the sides incorporated into the grip for orientation also please, make it so the pen has sides. also seriously you cant throw in a third switch on the back end of the pen as an eraser, would that break Huion&#8217;s piggy bank?To summarize: I found no problems with the hardware or the drivers for this product that weren't self inflicted or caused by the limitations of my own computer and or software that I used the tablet with, one small complaint that I have been able to happily deal with is that the pen needs a couple of small minor changes.. and the tilt? check the software that your using the tablet in and look for tilt settings in your brushes and adjust those, my tilt seem to work as good as my ability to set up the software for it.that's all happy Huion Customer here and I look forward to using more of there products....added note: this works flawlessly with Autodesk Sketchbook (now free)", 'Honestly I was sceptical at first because I wondered if I should buy a tablet with a built in screen. I received it and I&#8217;ve never been more pleased! It&#8217;s super fluid, easy to use and install. It gets a day or two to get used to it but after that the fun is yours. It also depends on the software you&#8217;re using, I&#8217;m using Clip Paint Studio on a MacBook Air and everything is running super smoothly. It is also quite big and very light so it&#8217;s great for drawing space. Excellent for beginners like me who want to get into digital art!</review><review> "As the heading above says. It's really nice, does everything as expected but the cord is annoyingly uncooperative. Has a cycle of being recognised and then not by my laptop. I really think it has to do with how tightly wound together the cord is in the packaging that the wiring inside is slightly damaged or something.Very frustrating.But functional and great!I think you just need a distance or so for the wiring to work efficiently.", 'I previously had the original 610pro and was impressed, I thought it was as good as a wacom intuosBut this, this is betterWAY WAY WAY more sensitive (fortunately you can adjust it to a level that works for you)8 customizable hot keys on the side work well, along with the soft touch along the top for extra features (togglable in settings)An amazing tablet, and well worth the price'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Brightness-Dimmable-Ringlight-Photography/dp/B07VDC1Y4T/ref=lp_16225009011_1_2983/147-9813770-0100168?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605591367&amp;sr=1-2983#customerReviews</link><review> \ "Great tripod. Nice and high which I needed. It's adjustable from short to very tall and the light is nice and bright. Made very beautiful photos. The remote works perfectly with my iPhone. The only thing is that the ring light broke off after just a couple uses. I think it's just a fluke but be careful. Don't be rough with it. I did contact customer service on amazon and even though at first they gave me a bit of hard time, they finally send a replacement but now I have to send the broken one back.

It also comes with a Bluetooth remote to help you take the picture if your posing across the room.My favorite part and the reason I got it is because this model has the phone clip in the middle of the ring light vs other models who close to place the phone clip on the actual stand it&#8217;s self. I would think it would be inconvenient to look down as you&#8217;re trying to record where as tho this model has the phone directly in front of you.</review><review> "This was my first ring light, great value. I placed this light in front of my body mirror for a much brighter light to try on clothes and take selfies.However, this one did not meet the lighting effects I wanted. It's due to my lack of knowledge of what I needed not the product. However, the only issue I had with the light is the adjustable stand will collapse easily.  The install was super easy and fast to place the light and stand together.I will use this light for my vanity lighting, not for the extreme lighting I'm looking for. I have to purchase a larger and much brighter light."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Schick-Multipurpose-Exfoliating-Dermaplaning-Precision/dp/B0787GLBMV/ref=lp_17938598011_1_28_a_it/140-7498895-7222569?srs=17938598011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605590215&amp;sr=8-28</link><review> \ "I'm a redhead with pale skin and light see thru hair on my arms and face. I'm a makeup artist and kept hearing from others about face shaving (dermaplanning) how it makes the makeup look better and skin glowy and decided why not, let's try it! And I'm so impressed! I wish I had a picture as I was using the tool how much white peach fuzz came off in small strokes! I loved the eyebrow tool, couldn't have shaped the brow without it! Its important to properly cleanse before using as you will be opening up your pores in the process for exfoliating, some of the reviews said they broke out and I imagine its bc they didnt properly cleanse. I washed my face and patted dry then used the product and rinsed with cold water and washed my hands with antibacterial soap. Then applied toner, serum and a high quality moisturizer. From research, they rec. Not wearing makeup the day you use this and gently cleanse and moisturize. So thats what I did! I dipped the blade in rubbing alcohol to sanitize after using. I don't know how some reviews said they cut theirselves with this tool, I was nervous to try this bc of said reviews but honestly no. Hold the tool at a 45 degree angle, make small strokes downward and hold the skin taut on the area you are doing. There's not way your going to draw blood. Good luck and give it a try!", 'I\'m a hairy gal. Hormonal problems ruled out by my physician, it\'s just hereditary. My cheeks, neck, forehead, and chin are covered in a fine ever-growing peach-fuzz. If I cease shaving, I shall acquire a boat and thus forth be dubbed blonde beard. My mustache is darker and thicker, something I think a lot of women experience.I have been shaving for a while with a men\'s razor (Gillette Fusion ProGlide for reference) and shaving cream but it just couldn\'t give me a close enough shave. ENTER SCHICK SILK TOUCH-UP! Holy Wow! I\'ve been dry shaving my entire face and some of my neck with these and no irritation plus it is the closest shave I have gotten. No pulling or scraping like other "mini-razors". It\'s quicker than doing what I call a "dad shave" in the shower and I can see what I\'m shaving because I\'m at my makeup table and there\'s no shaving cream obstructing my view (I don\'t want to accidentally hack off the hair by my ears or forehead). Plus, I compared this to other (what I call) mini-razors and it\'s twice the size (picture for reference, the pink one furthest to the right is this product)!! Obviously I\'m not new to the hair removal game. So very efficient for doing your whole face, easy for detailing those brows. There was a bit of skin buildup after scraping (it\'s called exfoliating, it\'s good for you because...it is) at my face but just wash off with soap and water and let air dry completely before you put a cap back on. I like to use a toner and moisturizer after shaving because I think that\'s what you should do after exfoliating.At the end of the day, everyone\'s skin is very different. While I experienced no irritation, some reviewers suggest that using these wet or with cream works better. So you should probably patch test to see what works for your skin and don\'t scream at me if this doesn\'t solve your problems, make you rich, and give you puppies.I love this product and hope that they sell it forever. It works on my peach fuzz, mustache, and brows. If I ever get word that they are going to stop making them, I will hoard them all.</review><review> 'Super easy and satisfying to use, you&#8217;re literally scraping all of the peach fuzz and dead skin off your face. The first photo shows all of the stuff that this product took off my face, and the second two photos are the before and after I used this product. My face is glowing and incredibly soft now. Highly recommend.</review><review> 'I regularly used the *tinkle* brand facial razors which I thought worked well but I just used one of these razors for the first time yesterday and OMG the amount of peach fuzz and to my surprise dead skin that came off was shocking and oh so satisfying. Will definitely be stocking up.</review><review> 'Love these. As I got older I noticed the thick peach fuzz. I hated it! I hesitated to use this product worried that the hair would come in coarse, but I was wrong. My aesthetician assured me that fine hair like peach fuzz would  only grow back as fine hair...the very same. I did my research over the internet and the info was the same. Now I can say that I happily use it and have a smooth, peach-fuzz free face. And the best news is that the hair takes many, many weeks to grow back.</review><review> "I've been using tinkle blades for several months but decided to try out this sponsored blade due to the many positive reviews. The Schick has been a huge disappointment. The blades were irregular at the top, leading to small scratches on my face no matter what angle I used. Also, the blades were somehow rougher on my skin while doing an inferior job at shaving the hair close. I gave up after trying the second blade. Will be returning to the tinkle.", "I ordered these razors after watching some videos on Youtube about dermaplaning at home. I have very visible 'peach fuzz' all over my face, particularly along my chin and jawline and above my upper lip. I can see it after applying foundation, though I'm not sure how visible it is to other people. Some children have commented that they can see hair on my face (even though it's mostly light in colour). These razors arrived today and I was so excited that I opened them right away and tried them out. It took me less than 5 minutes to dermaplane my entire face (this was my first time ever experiencing dermaplaning - have never had it done at a salon or elsewhere). The peach fuzz came off quickly and easily and I felt no risk of accidentally cutting myself. My skin is softer and smoother than it has ever felt in my entire adult life, and for the first time in memory, I want to go out without any makeup on to show off my great complexion. I will definitely be purchasing these again and highly recommend them."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Soopii-Charging-Organizer-Multiple-Electronics/dp/B07M6PKB9W/ref=lp_16225009011_1_7341_cpbg/140-2465021-8334206?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592884&amp;sr=1-7341</link><review> \ 'We needed a solution for our 3 iPads, 1 iPhone, 1 watch in the upstairs game room.

When I straighten it, the first couple days it looks great, then it starts to wave. So instead of fighting it, I use this to add more texture and great curls throughout. I don't ususally curl every strand of hair, just a few underneath and then around the top. It adds a great textured look and makes my hair look styled verses day three waves. You should try it!! It's easy to just wrap hair and go. The curls obviously depend on how much hair you grab. Underneath I do large chunks just to add wave and so it doesn't make my hair puffy. Top, about 1 inch sections random to get a tighter curl. Stay beautiful!!", "Sooo... I'll start by saying I'm almost 30 and have never been able to curl my hair.

I curled my 6 yr old daughters hair at 930 am and it stayed ALL DAY with it being 84 degrees, running and playing outside and in sweat and I didn't use any products before curling. She does have a  slight natural curl to her hair, keep that in mind as far as me saying all day. Her hair holds curl amazingly. Later that evening I decided to try my own hair because curling someone else's and your own are 2 different ball games. With that being said I did 5 random strands just to experiment with it and they turned out amazing! Its so easy to use and heats up fast! You cant go wrong with this tool.

For those looking for a good action camera you can hardly go wrong with this as it has most of the functions you need and want in a budget friendly camera. Let me be clear, GoPro makes a fantastic camera. Compared to the V50 Elite I think the GoPro 6/7 has better video and better audio and it&#8217;s waterproof without any external cases. With that being said, is the video and audio from the GoPro three times better than V50 elite? If you can live with a camera that needs an external case to be waterproof and has very good but not mind blowing video quality, then this is probably the camera for you. So for this review, I will not compare it to the GoPro Black 7, because that camera is in a different market for different buyers. Instead I will compare it to the 2017 V50 Pro.Maybe if I were a pro athlete needing the absolute best video  and video quality for  social media, then I would spend the $400 or so for a GoPro 7 but for a fraction of the price you can  get away with the slightly lower quality video and audio and not notice. Set the camera to 4K and 60 fps and you will get very good video quality with smooth recording and playback. Image stabilization was a feature introduced in last year&#8217;s V50 Pro 2017 model (which I also own) and it makes a return in this year&#8217;s model with good results. It helps stop some of the jittery video if you make a lot of tiny fast or twitchy  movements during recording. However the feature is no match for a good gimbal, but pair it with one and you will have super smooth video.For testing, I recorded the same objects/subjects using the 2018 V50 Elite mounted side by side with my 2017 V50 Pro. Both used the same memory cards with the factory camera case, and both set to their max 4k video settings. Camera setup is easy but unfortunately It doesn&#8217;t use a touch screen and you have to use the buttons to change settings. It comes with pretty much the same remote as last year, and you get a charger and two batteries that are interchangeable with last year&#8217;s. It also comes with an impressive amount of mounting clips and parts to help you mount the camera. The 2018 Elite was set to its max 4k 60 FPS and the 2017 V50 Pro was set to its max 4k 30 FPS setting. They were mounted to the same block when recording so that I could accurately compare video and I couldn&#8217;t say that camera angles or different video could cloud my judgement. I watched all videos on the same 4k TV.What I saw was that the video quality of the 2018 Elite is slightly better than that of the 2017 Pro. It is smoother than the Pro, and the colors were much more vibrant and popped on my screen more so than the 2017 Pro. However there were some videos that didn&#8217;t seem that different and I was hard pressed to tell a majorly discernible difference between the two. To me, the biggest difference between the two cameras is the color reproduction. Like I mentioned earlier, the colors are simply better on the 2018 Elite, and even watching the same video recording from two different cameras, I could tell which camera shot which footage by the difference in colors. They just seem to be more vibrant. I would never have noticed the difference if I didn&#8217;t see the footage from the 2018 Elite. So bottom line, the video recording is better with the 4k and 60 FPS Elite V50, the colors are better.  If you have the choice between the Elite and last year&#8217;s Pro, its an easy decision. I liked the 2017 Pro, but the slightly better video and the better color reproduction of the 2018 Elite makes it a better choice if you need an action camera and do not yet have one. If you already own the 2017 Pro and are thinking about upgrading to the 2018 model, then I would say hold off on that. While the video and color are better, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s worth the cost for a slight upgrade. I would wait until the 2019 version to see what upgrades they have in store. I was hoping for a waterproof camera like the GoPro that didn&#8217;t need the clear plastic case, but sadly the V50 still requires an external case. Also, the 2018 V50 Elite requires a memory card that can keep up with 4k video. I used a generic class 10 MicroSD card rated for 4k, but the AKASO would shut off after 5-10 seconds of recording. I thought that the camera was defective so when I contacted AKASO, they let me know that they recommended cards like the Samsung that was truly rated for 4k UHD recording. Once I replaced my generic with a genuine class 10 Samsung  EVO with 90mb/s write speed the camera stopped shutting off. Unfortunately both cameras have almost completely muted audio when mounted in their cases. Underwater or shooting on dry land the cases protect the cameras from the elements but also effectively mute the mic so you can barely hear any audio of any kind. Maybe AKASO can fix the audio for 2019. In order to hear anything you need to record outside of the case.So to recap: the video and colors are better on the 2018 V50 Elite compared to the 2017 V50 Pro. Its smoother and the colors are noticeably better. Its not quite the same quality as the GoPro 7 Black, but its close. You need a MicroSD card capable of 4k UHD recording at 90mb/s or the camera will shut off. The 2017 V50 didn&#8217;t have that problem, but then again the video is slightly less impressive. When used in the waterproof case, both cameras will barely be able to pick up audio. If you can live with these small issues and you don&#8217;t already own a 2017 V50 Pro and you don&#8217;t want or need to spend $400 on an action camera then you would do yourself a favor and buy this camera. Based on value and bang for the buck its easily a 4 star item. If then can make this camera with a touch screen, and make it waterproof without a case like the GoPro then this becomes an immediate 5 star buy, especially at its price point.</review><review> "First off I would like to say that I'm an oudoorman and use the camera for hunting, fishing and four wheeling. I just upgraded from the V50 to V50 elite. Here are some of my observations:Video quality at 4k 60 FPS is superb. I use a headmount strap and just let it run during my ATV trips. Unit was supplied with charger and two batteries.The waterproof case is of quality build with stainess steel access buttons. Had no issues with water getting in.So far I am very pleased with my choice picking Akaso V50 Elite. It also has voice control which I plan on using, along with the continue loop as a car cam. Will keep you posted.", 'I have compared this to the GoPro Hero 6 at 4k 30fps and this unit isn&#8217;t quite as good when it comes to picture quality and image stabilization but it is very close, and for less than half the price it is a much better deal. Since the 4k 60fps doesn&#8217;t have image stabilization this setting is only appropriate if used on a tripod in my opinion.I also have the Akaso V50 and the Elite&#8217;s image stabilization is much better, as is its low light and sound recording quality. The ability to zoom is also a nice improvement on the Elite. I also like the fact that Elite uses the same battery as the V50.I used the Akaso V50 as a travel and dash camera not as a traditional action camera. Using this camera on a tripod will take a video that when viewed in a VR system (like Oculus Rift) will almost make you feel you are back in that moment. I used it to record several locations on an Italy trip and viewing the video in VR really helps bring back the memories. It is not 3D of course but it does take good wide angle video.The Elite camera still has some issues the V50 had like limiting file size to 4GB (approx. 8.5min @ 4K 30FPS). This is probably to make the files compatible with older drives with FAT32 style formats. It is inconvenient however when you wish to record longer videos. Also the batteries only last about 35 minutes when recording 4K 30FPS.The Elite has a cool feature &#8220;Distortion Calibration&#8221; that removes the fisheye effect but it doesn&#8217;t work if recording at 4K 60FPS, if image stabilization is turned on, or if the Date/Time option is turned on, so it can rarely be used.Because of the way I use the camera I wish there was a lens cap accessory to allow me to easily carry it in my pocket without worrying about scratching the lens. I would also like a pause button on the camera itself that I could use while recording. I don&#8217;t typically use the remote much.So even though it is not perfect it still deserves 4.5 stars in my opinion for value &amp; quality, but if you have unlimited funds by a high end GoPro. I love the camera and will continue to use and recommend it.</review><review> 'Great Action Camera for the money! I was a Gro Pro Man before my Hero 5 kicked the bucket. I decided to give Akaso V50 Elite a shot and boy am I impressed. The image stability is top notch and the quality of the pics in all video modes are top notch. Video quality is good as well.

This one really fit the bill, though I do wish it was even smaller. I have two complaints, but nothing that takes away from the functionality of the stylus so I won't take off stars for this. First is that there is only one cap per pen so one end of the stylus is always exposed unless you borrow a cap from another pen. It would be nice to have two caps for each pen so one end doesn't get dirty when it's in a drawer or a bag.

Around 10 days to delivery but a lot cheaper even with shipping and customs (all dealt with automatically by amazon).I was worried the small base would let a lot of flame out around the side on a gas stove  but it boils well on a small pocket rocket type stove. Looks like it will work very well if put directly on/in the embers of a fire.The cups it comes with are cleanly designed and usefully insulated but are a bit too small to pair with the stove.The handle is secure and can be locked in place open or closed. The little plastic fliphandle on the lid is a possible weak point and I've had to slide the hinge-pin back in a couple of times to avoid losing it.All in all a good versatile oversize cup or undersize pot.", 'Using this with my Firebox stove and boil plate. Well made like that the handle attachment point is high up so a lot of the pot goes into the firebox and is an efficient and pretty windproof way to boil water, heat soup or stews. No bail handle but many folks have adapted their pots to get round this. There are many reviews and ways of using this on YouTube if people want to find out more before purchasing.Highly recommended.</review><review> "Really simple bit of kit, the quality and finish are great. Not for extended trips, it is ideal for day trips and shorter trips of a couple of days where you don't want to/need to vary the meal choices.The two cups it comes with are nice, don't lose heat so don't burn your hands either.The other thing is that they are pleasant to drink from, they are very well finished and comfortable on the mouth. May sound odd, but this sort of thing makes all the difference when you have had a long day and are rewarding yourself to a nice hot drink, it gives that little bit of luxury.All you need to do is add water and the view!!", "Excellent quality pot and two plastic insulated cups. My only complaint is that it will not hold my gas canister (even if you remove the cups it is too narrow), which I have to now carry seperately. This won't be a problem for some but I like to keep my fuel can inside the pot to reduce bulk and keep everything together.It's narrowness also meant it BARELY sits on top of my stove and I had a couple of near spillages. This will vary of course between stoves so again this will depend on what kit you use.It is a good quality set, no complaints there, and while a little weighty you do get the quality of stainless steel. The plastic cups are great too. I'm docking a star though just because it has been an inconvenience to use. Just my opinion!Also... SO EXPENSIVE! The seller I got mine from wanted an extortionate amount, which I paid as I needed a new pot at short notice and this had been on my list to try.

And I'm not very impressed so far . I used the pine tar, and the citrus based one, but I found that they both smelt very similar to each other . So that was a negative . They also lasted no time at all . Like maybe four to five days each . The product wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either . I doubt I would buy them again .", "I really hate to leave negative reviews, but this soap earned it. Each of the bars smells like soy beans and lasts all day. I will give them credit where credit is due: the scent is long-lasting and moisturizing. Had the soap smelled like Bay Rum or Pine Tar, this would have been a very different review. I'd love to smell like one of those all day. The problem is, this soap smells nothing like the descriptions/names.Sure, the colors and ingredients are slightly different, but each bar smells overwhelmingly of soy. Not to be crass, but there was nothing like unzipping my fly to take a leak, and the smell of soy beans trapped in my boxer briefs penetrating my senses like a dumpster fire. I've worked in restaurants my whole life, and, personally, I don't want to smell like warm tofu. As a first-time buyer, I was immensely dissatisfied and will never be purchasing these again.", 'This soap smells amazing, the pine tar is like a mix of pine treeseand orange peels, the bay rum is like a sweet bay breeze and the, island citrus is like lemons and oranges. I cant quite place the patchouli, but its pleasant and more subtle than the rest.I tried these out because the traditional soaps i was buying from the store were aggravating my eczema and i was told to try to change my soap to see if it did. I got these as well as the variety pack by Aegean,  these ones smell better, and the pine tar has sand and what appears to be small stones for exfoliating (which despite how it sounds feels pretty good actually,  like scratching an itch everywhere). However they do not leave the skin as well moisturized as the aegean did, and my eczema showed up after the end of my second bar, with the Aegean,  it did not come back throught using 4 of them before trying these. For refrence qhen using old spice and dial body soaps, my eczema would attack about every 4 days.So better than many store soaps  for skin care and and the price is good. Only problem is that they dont last very long. Despite my best efforts (using a soap saver, on a wire shelf i put on the far side of ththe shower and cutting the soap into 6ths, only having 1 section of the bar in the bathroom at a time) i just couldnt make it last. Where as the Aegean i would section into 6 pieces, each lasting 5-7 days (showering once a day), the same sections of these were lucky to make 3 days. Sometimes only lasting 2.  They lather much thicker and fluffier than most bar soaps but dont last well enough to he worth while.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Protector-Compatible-Samsung-LiquidSkin-Anti-Bubble/dp/B07VSJ8B4Z/ref=lp_16225009011_1_4967/146-8493176-5530069?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592045&amp;sr=1-4967</link><review> \ "I purchased the IQ screen protector for my new Samsung Galaxy Active Watch 2. The kit came with all that I needed to apply the screen protector. This is a wet kit meaning that you have to spray your fingers, screen protector and watch to install it. The instructions were spot on and I was able to center it on my smart watch. It's very clear and smooth and has no orange peel like ripples like some of the other cheaper name brand screen protectors.I had to take my time with it to ensure it was centered and once I was happy with that I used the included micro squeegee and pressed out the water and with the other hand I used a finger to hold it place because the screen protector can slide around as you squeegee out the water. It takes about a day for it to cure but I went ahead and used it as soon as I installed it and had no issues. The only thing I wish I hadn't done was wear a long sleeve shirt because as soon as I installed it I put on the watch and a little lint got stuck under the film at the edges. The lint went away after a few days. Also once you press out the water, use the included micro squeegee to press down the rounded edges of the screen protector. When you first install it wet, the edges will not stick down because the edges of the watch are rounded. This goes for all Samsung Galaxy rounded edge screens. I'm really happy with the quality of the screen protector and the included items needed to apply it.", 'Being familiar with wet installs, this was a breeze. Self healing, almost gel-like film, though it doesn\'t look clear when the screen is off, when its on, you can\'t tell anything is on it. I tried a few 44mm films for my Active2 and these work the best so far. You need a wet film install for screens that curve at the edge. no matter what do not ever buy tempered glass, its trash.TIP: Once you squeegee the film and everything is perfectly centered, the edges will still not adhere to screen completely. let it dry a bit by leaving it alone for 5-10 minutes, and then get the squeegee and press down outwards and slowly rotate across the entire edge. You will notice it sticks as the film stretches microscopically and "grabs" on and sticks to the edge.There are better not so gel-like thick films out there that are also wet installs but since this product is new IQ Shield is more than enough to do the job. Its a great product.</review><review> "I bought a smartwatch, and I knew it had to have a screen protector because everything I own has had some kind of screen protector. I didn't want to go with tempered glass, and I've had great success with this kind of wet application on phones and tablets, so I decided to give this a try. And with 6 protectors in the box, I knew I was covered in case I messed something up. I will admit I was concerned about getting the screen protector to fit evenly around the watch face, but it wasn't a problem at all.I followed all the directions and BOOM, the first protector went on perfectly. I was able to scotch it around the glass so I didn't have any hanging over any of the sides (it's a perfect fit but you do have to finesse it a bit) and let it dry overnight. The next morning it had bonded and dried and you couldn't even tell it was on the watch. No overhang, no bubbles, no parts lifted off the watch. I'm not sure I've had better luck with any kind of protector installation.After a few weeks, no problems at all, it's still stuck on and you can't tell it's there. Watch sensitivity is perfect all around the screen and I know I've got some protection in case I bump my wrist somewhere. High quality product and highly recommended. Just take your time and follow the instructions word for word and you'll be fine.", "Instructions provided clearly and protects the watch from scratch...

There are numerous posts about this on GoPro's forum, and it's clear that GoPro is not going to resolve this.You can expect that your camera might work on the first try of pairing with your remote, but any attempt after that is very hit or miss. Support's suggestions are going to be to reset everything and try again, but this is not your fault... and that is not a solution.If you are trying to use multiple cameras, which this is marketed for, you are in for a lot of frustration. The controller and cameras are NOT designed for guaranteeing anything you do on the controller will happen on the remote. If the message is lost (it's UDP over WIFI, that WILL HAPPEN), it will not try to ensure it is rechecked. Your camera will not stop recording, not start recording, not turn off... whatever... it WILL happen REPEATEDLY.Buyer beware!", "I was only able to use this remote twice! It corroded after the first use which was in water. I was able to clean the corroded area which allowed it to finally charge. After that I decided not to take it in the water, but after the second use (not in water) it decided to not charge again and I haven't been able to get it to charge since. It was great using it, but what a bummer...it was a waste of $80 and I can no longer get a refund! Thanks a lot GoPro.", "Got this specifically for a job involving large machinery (bulldozers) where I would need to set the cameras up &amp; then activate at specific times and needed to do it remotely as once the dozers were in action I couldn't stop them.Had multiple issues getting the cameras to connect &amp; stay connected so I updated both (Hero 7 Black) to the latest firmware, then again manually, reset the 'smart' remote.  Seemed to work ok in the office although when the battery is changed they reset and you have to pair again (this is a 'feature' according to the GoPro rep on their help chat).Got on site, paired the cameras &amp; remote, the dozers started work and the remote completely failed to pick up either camera.  They were less than 20m from me and still no connection whatsoever.  I wasted an entire day's filming thanks to this hopeless remote and the opportunity to film this was a one off.  I was fuming.I had also hoped that GoPro might have worked out how you could control multiple cameras independently with the remote but it either switches them both on &amp; off at the same time or not at all, as in my experience.GoPro connectivity has always been flaky in my experience but these days this is unacceptable.  Very disappointed.", "It's a good idea to have one of these remotes if you carry a number of GoPro's in your kit bag. The remote can have up to 50 GoPro's paired via the GoPro WiFi comms option and makes syncing of content capture simple to do. I can have up to 4 GoPro's set up at any one time, usually placed around my motorbike or sometimes on other riders bikes. As long as you are within around 10 meters you can simply hit a the record button and have them all trigger at the same time.The remote also gives you the option to change the capture state (and other settings) of your GoPro's from video/loop to photo modes. Great if you are using GoPro Sessions which are always fiddly to configure. The biggest advantage is that you can start and stop recording capturing only of the content you want without having to have the camera's rolling all the time. This saves you having to trawl through vast amounts of unwanted video when editing, but more importantly saves space on your SD card and also extends the battery life of the power hungry GoPro's, which means you don't miss out on crucial action shots.", 'I am not particularly impressed by this remote control, it simply doesn&#8217;t work reliably. I wanted to use it to switch on two GoPros at the same time. I gave up and almost smashed the remote control through the wall. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t, sometimes it shows it&#8217;s connected, but it isn&#8217;t and sometimes it is the other way around. Actually it is rubbish and far too expensive. To be fair it works with one GoPro, but definitely not reliably with two or even more GoPros. I would never ever buy it again.</review><review> '1) the screen is too small and is the lettering, the physical dimensions are fine, but the size of the LCD screen needs to be larger, letters on screen need to be a lot bigger.2) In normal sunlight the screen LCD goes dark/black and I am unable to read anything on the screen.3) Once you have paired both the gopro and remote, it all works perfectly, however it only works for a short while(15-20min) and then the remote no longer communicates with camera and none of the remote functionality works - at all, this happens all the time.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L89YC31/ref=lp_16225007011_1_1315_twi_col_ti_2/131-2492314-4761331?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594154&amp;sr=1-1315</link><review> \ 'Update, this review is for the wireless, non Bluetooth, version. Be advised that a lot of these reviews listed as "product purchased: t4pro" reflect the experience with a the original "Gamesir T4 wireless", not the Bluetooth equipped "Gamesir T4 Pro":I advice against use with Android devices.I\'ve noticed the controller can operate in 2 wireless modes not documented in the manual. Modes are switched by holding down the home button. One undocumented mode illuminates mode indicator LEDs 2 and 3. The other undocumented mode does not illuminate any mode indicator LEDs. Xinput mode is indicated by mode LEDs 1 and 4 being illuminated. Dinput mode is indicated by mode LEDs 1 and 3 being illuminated.Tested on 2015 Nvidia Shield TV 500GB (Android TV OS). When the USB dongle is plugged into my Shield device, it enters into a mode not documented in the manual. No mode LEDs are illuminated. Unintuitive button mapping is the result. It will not switch modes when connected to Shield device.Tested on Mecool M8S Plus W (Android mobile OS).Works best with undocumented mode that illuminates mode indicator LEDs 2 and 3. Xinput mode (LEDs 1 and 4) is not recognized. Dinput mode (LEDs 1 and 3) is recognized, but has odd button mapping. With mode indicator LEDs 2 and 3 illuminated button mapping is intuitive, but home button doesn\'t bring me back to my home screen, it does nothing. Retroarch can acknowledge in two modes (LEDs 1+3, LEDs 2+3), but cannot identify Gamesir device in any mode. Gamesir device will not go into the undocumented mode that it defaults to on my Shield device.

I\'ve owned the original in blue switches, red LED for some time, but wanted an upgrade to quieter switches to hear audio better and get some nice rgb.It seems that both Cherry and Corsair have tried to cut corners in places that are less likely to be immediately noticed by customers. This will still very much yield a lesser quality, and more likely to fail over time product.-Compared to the original K70, the overall quality of this product is less. The first and most glaring thing I noticed are the stabilizers for larger keys (space, 0, shift, etc) are far looser/poorly fit on the mk2. The black retention pieces (see video) have SO much slop compared to the original. I can only really get any movement on the original if I really force it. This creates not just extra movement on the keys, but it also makes it noisey. Often times, this is part of what gives people that notorious spacebar rattle. As pieces wear over time this will only get worse. Especially for a transcriber, I have several special functions that rely on shift and combinations of shift with other keys. The extra slop is noticeable compared to the first version and I can hear it almost as loud as blue switches through headphones when transcribing audio. Already I have an awful amount of audible rattle on my backspace key, while my original is rock solid.-A second thing I\'ve noticed is how they\'ve relaxed the tolerances on the key caps and switch stems is. On the original version, it was very difficult to remove the key caps from the switches unless you had a wire puller. On the "updated" mk2, they pop off so easily and can be put back on with so little finger pressure, I almost didn\'t believe I had them on. This is not a good thing: it will make the caps more susceptible to wear that will create more slop, and overall just does not convey quality. If you\'ve ever had a spacebar that had a problem where overtime if you hit one side of the key and the other side would pop up and stay there, this is why: keycaps/stems with poor tolerances.-Third, the switches themselves have more play in them than the original k70. It created a noticeable amount more key wobble.Overall, after a year and hundreds upon hundreds of hard typing and key smashing when raging, my original k70 is still a higher quality product than the new mk2. The tighter tolerances on the original almost make it feel like a newer product than the mk2 I got in the mail literally today. The overall typing experience on the mk2 is just sloppier and it does not inspire confidence in the long run. Some upgrades are admittedly awesome. The clear switches really enhance the lighting, the on-board profile storage is fantastic. HOWEVER, looking at it in terms of the functionality this piece of hardware is required/designed to perform, (TYPING) they clearly decided to throw away some quality in favor of some pretty bells and whistles. If I had never experienced another high end keyboard, specifically the predecessor, I may have given this a higher rating, but in lieu of knowing what\'s being lost, I can\'t.At some level, it\'s almost insulting that they\'re trying to pass this off as an "upgrade" when they\'ve reduced the essential functions of their original to something of lesser quality.</review><review> "If you go on r/MechanicalKeyboards you'll see corsair keyboards getting a lot of flack for being overpriced for for their quality but honestly I don't really see it, I think the quality is good enough, it's no tank but for something that will just sit on your desk the whole time it really doesn't need to be. The mk.2 seems to be sturdy enough, the top is a fairly thick piece of aluminum, about as thick as I would expect a keyboard faceplate to be at least, and the whole thing is fairly ridged overall. The bottom of made of plastic and I see people complain that it's too thin but if you're not using your keyboard to bludgeon your enemies then it should hold up just finr. My biggest gripe with this keyboard are the keycaps, they're light, thin and laser ablated so they're likely to wear over time. Corsair offers a doubleshot version of these same keycaps, but they're another $50 so if you're set on getting those then this starts to become a nearly $200 keyboard. That being said, I think that if quality had to be sacrificed somewhere to meet this price point then the keycaps are the most logical option as they're the only part of the keyboard you can easily modify yourself if you want and I really don't see them as a huge problem until they actually start to wear. This keyboard comes with another set of WASD and QERF keys with a textured surface that won't wear so if you mostly use those it's probably not a huge issue. I suppose only time will tell how bad these keys wear.I was looking for several things in a keyboard, I wanted an aluminum top plate, a minimal, clean look, RGB and I wanted it to be mechanical and this keyboard meets all those things.I really like the brushed aluminum, it doesn't take on finger prints, it looks really good and it adds some good heft so full points there. The switches protrude out of the faceplate so there is nowhere for dirt and dust to fall in to and get trapped, this makes it really easy to clean with one of those compressed air cans so if you like to keep things clean then that is a huge plus. This is a really good looking keyboard, it doesn't overdo it by trying to look all gamery and wouldn't look out of place in an office or anything (with the RGB off at least), though you can see the pictures for yourself so whether you like how it looks is really up to you.The RGB is fully customizable on a per key basis but if you want all the fancy effects then you always need to have the corsair iCUE software running in the background which I'm not a huge fan of. You can save three RGB profiles onto the keyboards internal memory but the effects are a bit more limited if you chose to rely only on that. You can still set each key to any color you want and you can use some effects, but the effects can't be as elaborate as if you have the software running in the background. This isn't a huge problem for me because I don't really want much more than static back lighting anyway but its something you should be aware of. I guess each key can be readdressed to do whatever you want and you can make macros, but this particular model doesn't have any dedicated macro keys. These aren't really features that I've needed to use and so I don't particularly care about them.I got the version with the cherry mx brown switches because up to now I've been using a keyboard with blue clones and I wanted to try something different. I miss the clickyness of the blues but I like the feel of the browns well enough, I only wish that they were more tactile because the tactile bump isn't super prominent and isn't very sharp.  The browns are a lot less noisy that blues but they're still nowhere near silent. Most of the sound just comes from the keys bottoming out so it could be made just a little more silent with some o-rings but I don't like the feel of the o-rings as much. I considered returning this key board and getting the version with the blue switches for a little while but I've grown to like the brown switches, but it's all subjective. A lot of hard core mech keyboard enthusiasts don't really like browns but I don't have much experience with other switches so I can't say too much about that.The dedicated media controls are nice to have I suppose, but I only ever find myself using the volume knob. The wrist rest is just solid plastic but it has a soft texture and is definitely a plus, I haven't used one up to now but I don't think I could go without one in the future as it makes typing so much more comfortable. The USB passthrough is a nice feature, I use it for my wireless mouse dongle so that it's closer and the connection is more reliable but I imagine that it would be really convenient for a wired mouse as well, there are some routing channels on the bottom of the keyboard for the wire to keep things tidy if you do use a wired mouse . I don't think the passthrough wouldn't be ideal for something that you would remove and insert frequently because it's on the back of the keyboard which makes it awkward to get to in my opinion. The USB cable is braided and really thick which gives it a pretty premium feel. It's also super long so you shouldn't have much trouble getting it to where you need it to go. It's pretty ridged so if you move the keyboard around a lot on your desk that might be a bit of a problem.This keyboard really needs to be packaged better, Amazon just ships it in the box that the keyboard comes in and there isn't any foam or anything in that box so the only thing between the top of the keyboard and the boxes that will inevitably be dropped or stacked on top of it during shipping is a piece of cardboard. Because of this, my keyboard came with some of the keys knocked out both times, I replaced my first one because I thought it came broken. The first one's volume wheel was really loose compared to the second one I received, I don't know if that was a manufacturing defect or from rough treatment during shipping but it would be nice if Amazon just shipped it in another box with some proper packing material.", "I liked this model of keyboard more than most other models I found in a similar price range.  Cherry Brown switches, wrist-rest, very pose-able, non-obnoxious backlighting.  The audio controls are a plus, too.  So why did I give it three stars?The first time I received this keyboard it came with an Enter and P key which would spit out a string of random keys.  The Enter keystring would include F12, which is incredibly annoying and unacceptable for a 100+ USD device.  I sent it back for a new keyboard of the same make.The second time I received this keyboard, the box lid was torn, the seals were open, and the keyboard was packaged in such a way that I believe it was previously unboxed and used.  Some of the wrist-rest clips were broken off.  I did not even try to plug it in and test it.  I sent it back for a new keyboard of the same make.The third time I received this keyboard, it was mint-condition new.  I am typing on it now, and I love it (just as I expected I would).  I bought the Cherry MX Brown Red LED version.Amazon has been very quick to deliver my replacements.  I don't know whether fulfillment services are wonky around New Year's, or if Corsair sent a bad batch of keyboards to Amazon, or maybe both given the disparately bad state of my two now-returned models.  The ordeal was very frustrating, but I am glad I chose the product in the end.", "I'm not a gamer, I just love good gear, and I have very poor vision. I've been looking for a decent backlit keyboard for a long time. This is it.In the '80s, I used the IBM Model F and Model M keyboards, which I loved, but my all-time favourite keyboard was made by a long-dead company called Wang. It was the best typists keyboard that I ever found - 'til now.The brown switches have the same action and feel as my old beloved Wang keyboard. When I was shopping for a new keyboard, I was actually looking for blue switches, but I think I'm better off with the browns. The superb backlighting of this keyboard ensures that I can actually read the key legends. The iCUE software, once you figure it out, is great for developing new colour themes, but it does have a learning curve.The K70 Mk.2 is an all around great keyboard. It is expensive, but even though I don't care about any of the advanced gaming features, for me it is worth every penny. Even if you're not a gamer, it comes highly recommended.", 'Bought this on Black Friday 2019. It\'s now July 2020 and the keyboard is already dead.1- Keys are flimsy and easily come off with slight sideways brushes or with routine use.2- Keys are easily broken. The gaming "D" broke off after a month,.3- Num 5 stopped working out of the blue after a couple of months4- Some key presses seems to have gotten stuck and the keyboard became unusable. It doesn\'t appear to be one key in particular, but the entire numpad keys that are stuck because it keeps sending nothing but strings of numbers.No accident or dirt got into it, so I got no outside explanation for this rapid deterioration.Other wise, the rest of the keyboard looked solid and the keys were responsive during. The software is basic. But the built quality was less than impressive. For a 110$ keyboard, not even lasting a year feels like a ripoff.</review><review> "I don't use this keyboard for gaming. I ordered it to have a stiff, but balanced response to my typing power. I learned to type on a mechanical keyboard way back in high school. So I hit the keys harder than anyone who learned touch typing. This Cherry Brown MX key type on the Corsair Gaming K70 Lux is the perfect balance between offering resistance and accuracy when typing text, without being too stiff.  The software works very nicely but I don't use any of the advanced gaming features, so I cannot comment on that aspect of the software in terms of stability etc...It is a solid keyboard made of metal and the wrist rest makes it complete because of the support and comfort it provides. Corsair makes good products. I am also using Corsair RAM memory in my computer and it is rock solid for over a year now.", "Buying this keyboard was a huge mistake. Why? Because I love it so much that I ended up having to get 3 more for my other PC's. The keystrokes are the perfect weight for me. I had been using laptop-style keys on my keyboards for years and I can't believe I put up with that style of keyboard.I love everything about this keyboard. The brushed metal base, the volume and audio controls, the replacement WASD keys, it's all fantastic.There may be better keyboards, but this one is the best I've ever owned."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Teals-Foaming-Soothe-Lavender/dp/B0080D1Q52/ref=lp_16225006011_1_13_sns/135-9399278-7481561?s=beauty-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594557&amp;sr=1-13</link><review> \ 'Fabulous scent!!

The set was still in good working condition beyond that.My second set is still is working. I hear others just fine and others hear me just fine. That's all I need it to do. The one problem with the set is the design of the earbud. It has a round design with a flat face/front. As opposed to domed. It's also relatively large, compared to a set you would get with your phone.So here is the problem with this. It is so large it only fits in one my ears, the right side.

It adds a great amount of protection while not adding a bunch of bulk. I would say it is just slightly(barely) thicker than the iPhone leather case.

Connected to a Seagate 500mb SATA drive with no problem, read it, formatted it. No problem.I have an old 44pin IDE drive and this device does not allow for a 44 pin IDE drive. Solution appears to be simple with an inexpensive 44 pin female to 40 pin male adapter. I just mention it case you have the same pin count on a drive you want to hookup. You'll need an adapter.", 'I purchased this product around the same time that I purchased a competitive product.  The reason that I purchased two devices with the same approximate function was I had a need to back up drives and occasionally the drives would be of the same kind, i.e. SATA to SATA, IDE to IDE, and so forth.  Neither device could accommodate two drives of the same type so I purchased a secondary USB drive adapter that I thought would function as my backup USB to disk adapter.  The other device was a big, hulking plastic monstrosity that was poorly designed and constantly bent IDE pins and quickly proved itself so frustrating that I now only use that product when I have to.  This product is now my primary and I haven\'t looked back or regretted the change once.I found this product to be elegant by comparison to the other - for instance you could see where the connector was making contact with the drive and therefore no bent pins!  No more blindly hoping your drive makes proper contact with the adapter without damaging one or the other.  Imagine!  In addition, this product\'s claim of USB 3.0?  It\'s legit.  Here is output from /var/log/messages I collected just now: "bcdUSB  3.00".  The other product?  It is not usb 3.0 despite packaging claims that it is.  When purchasing an item to act as a USB to disk adapter being able to connect to drives via USB 3.0 instead of 2.0 can make a big difference.Another win for me is the fact that this is a powered USB disk adapter.  During normal use I have the drive adapters plugged into a Raspberry Pi 4, a small single-board computer that is very low-power in comparison to modern desktops and laptops.  The extra power for the adapter is greatly appreciated because without it I could not power larger form-factor SATA drives or IDE drives and likely others.  The adapter plugged into the wall provides a nice, steady flow of power that in turn powers the drives connected to it when necessary and that keeps things working smoothly.If pressed and I had to make a complaint about this product I would say that when connected to a SATA drive the connection feels like it would be easy to pull apart by accident.  Just be careful and don\'t handle the drive while it is in use (especially a spinning platter drive for obvious reasons) and you won\'t have a problem.How much do I like this product?  Enough that I am going to purchase a second one so I no longer have to deal with the other disk adapter.  At this price the product pays for itself in time saved fixing IDE pins I would have bent with the other adapter.</review><review> 'Purchased to clone HDDs from old laptops into new SSDs.

A big THANK YOU to the seller for so quickly sending me a replacement after I\'d messed up the installation.My suggestions for perfect installation:1. Make sure the placement guide is correctly snapped onto your phone.2. Instead of aligning and pressing in the bottom edge first, I found that by gently "floating" the entire protector over the screen and fine tuning the alignment prior to the pressing it into place made a huge improvement.</review><review> 'Was looking forward to better protection after I had to repair the screen on my s8. This glass protector is frustrating to say the least. I have to press harder and usually double or triple tap to get things to register which was not the case before.  Not sure if this will be staying on my phone...</review><review> "Edit (20.11.18): Accidentally dropped my phone and I'm thanking myself for biting the bullet and buying a protector! Side note, I can confirm that the sensitivity of my screen is lessened. Fullstops/periods appear in the wrong places when blind typing - not much of an issue still but worth clarifying.Now let me start off by saying that I don't often write reviews. But not even 1 hour in, I felt the need to let others know the benefits and drawbacks to this screen protector.For basically &#163;10, I highly recommend this for someone who just wants to add an additional layer of protection to your Galaxy S8 because it has very few negative effects*. I've never been a fan of screen protectors because I'm an OCD freak and the slightest misalignment or even a single bubble will make me take it off and toss it into the bin, never to be seen again. But because the S8 is the most expensive phone I have ever owned (not forgetting the ridiculous price for a replacement display panel) so I decided to take the chance and see if I could finally be able to keep it on for longer than 2 minutes.This protector is not only really straightforward in regards to the installation, it's application on the screen is even better too. The claim of it being glass, I'm going to say that it is genuine glass or at least a durable and resistant plastic.*the only 2 problems that I can think of are to do with the screen of the phone being curved and the sensitivity of the protector with the phones panel. I'm a pretty heavy Discord App user and because the S8 screen is curved, new message dots get wrapped around the screen as well. This protector limits whether I can see those dots or not and I have found a way to see the message dots which is turning the phone to the side and looking.*the second issue is the sensitivity of the 'dot matrix'. Whether it's just a case of my own error during the installation or if its the protector, I'm unsure. But as of typing this, I have made more spelling mistakes than I usually make. I have had 1 duplicated word while typing which makes this product lesser suited for someone who focuses on typing and doing it accurately. Again, this could be my own fault with not making a correct installation but I thought I would still share it nevertheless.My final conclusion is that for what it is worth, go right ahead and buy it. But please don't expect it to be a keeper.. It will stay on my S8 until it either breaks or I get a better one.I know this is a stupidly long review so I will briefly sum it up;Is it good for the price? Most certainly!Does it seem durable? Personally, it is too early to be 100% absolute on the durability but it feels like it will do the job.How is the touch response? Pretty good for the most part, minus the typing issues might be my own error.Is it case friendly? Yup, my case fits it perfectly with no lift-up or anything that degrades the integrity of the protector.", "I am writing this after ordering my second one of these my first protected my phone perfectly when I dropped it on its face on a concrete floor hello not have had this screen protector on my phone would probably have broken the screen definitely would have cracked in multiple places when I dropped my phone at like I did my heart stopped when I picked it up I was sure I was going to have to spend money to get it repaired money that I didn't have readily available so when I realised that it was actually the screen protector that was broke and not my phone I was very very relieved I quickly ordered another one. Yes this screen protector does somewhat reduce the sensitivity of the touch screen but that is a small price to pay to protect my phone and you do soon get used to having to press the buttons a teensy bit harder. this screen protector is extremely easy to install unlike other ones where you have to put stickers on certain places and then watch it slowly stick to the phone trying your best to avoid any air bubbles which never works and normally looks awful on the phone which is annoying after spending so much on the phone to see it looking tacky this screen protector however stick straight away and I haven't got a single air bubble and I'm really not the best using things like this so I'm very happy would definitely recommend and would definitely buy again as I'm sure I will drop my friend again and I will need to order again", 'Really disappointed with this screen protector. Followed instructions and fitted to phone perfectly. Once secured you are unable to pull down the screen (to show notifications / wifi / sound shortcuts) due to protector being slightly too short.

It seemed to have better options than the other apps.You'll need to manually lighten or brighten the photos before printing as they print a little dark than what you'll see on your phone. It takes some getting used to. Just revert the photo after you're done printing.There was a lot of negative reviews on the app that apparently made it unusable or clunky to use but they have a new app or updated version following the bad reviews. Look for 'Polaroid Zip' app which worked fine for me printing over 20 photos in multiple sessions for my scrapbook.", 'I did a lot of research on printers and by far this is the best to buy. The reasons are endless, but the app and the printer makes beautiful pictures. There are so many options from boarders, adjusting lighting, resizing, rotating, collage and the list goes on and on. This little printer does more than a big one can. Another added bonus is the picture back peels of to use as a sticker or put on a magnet for the office pics. I use my planner also like a memory keeper of the day to day happenings. So when I can grab a quick pic of the grandkids, in the moment, on my phone later in the evening I print the perfect size and stick it into my planner. Now I am not letting little moments slip away. Nor do I have to drag a photo album out to see it.I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this printer and will be giving them as gifts this year to family and friends. 10 Stars and all thumbs up!</review><review> 'Ho acquistato questo prodotto per regalarlo alla mia ragazza.Ero indeciso se comprare direttamente la Polaroid che scatta le foto o il prodotto in questione.Dopo un po\' di pensamenti, ho escluso la fotocamera in quanto le foto sarebbero state di qualit&#224; pi&#249; basse! Mai scelta fu pi&#249; azzeccata!Con questo prodotto potrete stampare nell\'immediato le foto che si scattano con il proprio smartphone.&#200; stato utilizzato con un iPhone ma &#232; pienamente compatibile con qualsiasi sistema operativo.&#200; necessario scaricare l\'applicazione apposita sul cellulare, per utilizzarlo. Funziona tramite bluetooth e dopo una prima operazione di abbinamento tra i dispositivi, la procedura di stampa &#232; veramente veloce (stimata tra circa 30secondi e il minuto).Molto apprezzata la funzione di "foto multiple" per creare una sorta di mosaico, con pi&#249; foto da attaccare/avvicinare tra di loro.Nella confezione si trovano gi&#224; 10 pellicole ma ho preferito acquistare assieme al dispositivo, anche una confezione extra per scorta.La durata della batteria &#232; notevole (non si pu&#242; sapere la % di batteria residua per&#242;, purtroppo), e si pu&#242; caricare sia tramite USB sia tramite corrente (sarebbe consigliata la prima opzione, per&#242;):Il rapporto qualit&#224; prezzo &#232; fantastico, consiglio ad occhi chiusi l\'acquisto di tale prodotto!

Dass die Fotos teuer sind wei&#223; man im Vorfeld, daher werte ich das nicht ab.Was mich allerdings schon endt&#228;uscht hat ist die Qualit&#228;t der Fotos. Sie sehen ausgedruckt einfach von den Farben her nicht sch&#246;n aus. Nicht so strahlend und leuchtend, eher dunkel, selbst bei Fotos die bei hellstem Sonnenschein gemacht wurden.

We decided to have our boys share a bedroom and have the other room as a playroom. We had to rearrange furniture and the internet cable was no longer hidden. It was exposed and hazardous for my one year old. I quickly jumped on Amazon and ordered this cable concealer and switch cover for a one day delivery. It is now installed and looks fantastic! Awesome product!</review><review> 'The kit worked very well for concealing the small speaker wires for a Vizio sound bar surround sound speakers in our game room. The speaker wires are the very thin type and easily fit inside the track. Thicker wires would need a larger size.The pieces are fairly short so I had to stack them on top of each other to reach the speakers mounted at 8ft.The backing piece is pretty tightly attached to the front piece and getting it to pop away is a little difficult. It\'s easy to distort or "stretch" the plastic if you pry them apart by inserting something like a screwdriver. I found that grabbing an end of the backing with a pair of needle nose pliers and sliding it up or down while it\'s still attached allows you to separate them more easily.Since there would be very little stress on the track pieces I opted to just use a short bit of adhesive on the back of each end so they would be easy to remove from the wall, hopefully without damaging the paint some day.The kit includes couplings but after installing all of the tracks the joints were very hard to see so I decided not to use them. Unless you\'re standing very close to it, the track joints are almost invisible.I chose gray since our walls are painted light gray. The tracks are darker, but I think they look better than white probably would. They say they can be painted but they seem fine as-is.For hiding small wires quickly (where you don\'t want to cut into drywall, etc.,) these work perfectly IMHO.Recommended.</review><review> 'Very nice racetrack cord hider. I bought it to conceal two telephone cords. It is a one cord racetrack that fit these two small cords but was too small to fit a very thick (3/8") single HDMI cable. It has about 13\' of "concealer" and lots of couplings/elbows. Wish I had taken before pics as these do really give a much cleaner look.Pros- Besides the tape issues, very easy to install. I had more than enough racetrack to conceal the cords I wanted to and enough to conceal a single power cord from my t.v. (pic #3).Cons (why not five stars?)- I think it would be a much better value at about $2 dollars cheaper. It was difficult to peel the backing off of the two faced tape as it kept pulling off the concealer. I felt more comfortable putting screws in the horizontal runs. Even though they list it as a one cord concealer it did easily fit two phone cable and would have loved to have a tee adapter. I had to drill a hole in one of the elbows to let the two wires go their seperate ways (pic #4).</review><review> 'As a do it yourselfer, I appreciate a product that works as described. This cable concealer works great and makes my installation of my surround sound speakers look great! It is not reasonable for me to hide my wires inside the wall, so this solved the problem nicely! I am very impressed with the way it looks and how well  it went up. I do not know how well the adhesive will last, so that remains to be seen, but if it starts to give way as I do have textured walls, I will tack up with my hot glue gun.UPDATE: I did have a couple of areas where the adhesive didn&#8217;t stick to my textured wall and I did use the hot glue gun. Worked like a charm and it looks so nice now that the project is done!</review><review> 'Great product overall. Was easy to install. Quality plastic and great connectors. Easy to cut the sections with a razor saw or exacto knife to fit into tight spaces. Found that you get a more seamless look if you skip the inline connectors.

When I first bought it, I thought it was a steal, in terms of price and style. I really liked it, and it worked great on my hair. Mind you, I have kinky afro hair, so that says a lot. However, rapidly over time, the ceramic plates quickly became burnt and started damaging my hair, even on low temperatures. The effectiveness of this straightener began to diminish about a year into me owning this. I figured the main reason for this was because this straightener was cheaply made. Of course, upon opening it for the first time, you think the best of it. However it began to wear out a lot faster than I thought it would. For the price, I would say it's a huge steal, as straighteners can get very expensive...

I didn't realize how difficult it would be to set up. It won't connect to wifi until you supply the password but there's no way to connect to the printer to supply a password except through the network. The desktop software couldn't find the printer (tried repeatedly). I installed the HP Smart app on my Android phone and that found the printer (possibly using bluetooth). It took two tries, but I was able to add the password. Then I hit my next problem: It wants to print, but there are no setup instructions. I didn't realize it, but there seems to be no paper cartridge and I don't know where the paper goes or how to install the ink. The setup software is supposed to walk me through it, but the Android app didn't. Possibly the desktop software does. This is taking forever. This printer is cheap, but setup sucks.Edit: The desktop software does, in fact, guide you through setup quite nicely. I'm going to stick with my 1-star rating. If you don't mind solving technical difficulties and you want the cheapest possible solution, this might be for you. Eventually it prints. But I cannot imagine my parents, wife, or children getting this printer working wirelessly. They would already have sent it back saying it doesn't work. BTW, there is no USB cable, but  Imagine it's a lot easier to setup wifi if you buy a USB printer cable and set up the printer on a connected laptop or desktop. But that's speculation.Pro tip #1: When you set-up the printer, it will ask you for a PIN repeatedly. It's inside the door where you install the ink. If you cannot lift the printer, or crouch down, it will be hard to read the label. I took a picture of the label, to make it easier and so I wouldn't have to go into the room and find the PIN.Pro tip #2: When you do connect the printer to wifi, you will get an IP address like 192.168.0.11 (your address will be assigned by your router and will be different) and if you then copy that IP address into the address bar of a web browser, you can access a lot of configuration, reports, etc. The HP Smart software may give you similar access, but if so I couldn't find it.

Out of the box the printer is set to high quality printing with ink costs of around 10 cents per page.... If connected to a PC you have several available settings that make the printer more user friendly and affordable to print .. I must say the print quality is great even on plain paper.  Printer prices have increased 10 to 20 percent during Covid but I expect them to start dropping....

Was able to fit under my bathroom hotel faucet for filling.</review><review> 'I was looking for a mega bottle to store filtered water in my fridge that was leakproof and something that could stand upright in my fridge door without falling out when I opened it.  Great mammoth bottle, nice wide opening for filling and it appears a new  innovation of the magnetic cap that is held back when unscrewed as if by magic back whilst your pour of sip from the bottle.I am a fan of the Chute bottle and I have owned the one I have with the tether for over 6 years and it still surviving being dropped and heavy use on a daily basis.The only concern I have for this new style bottle is that Camelbak have introduced rubber seals to both the large opening and the small cap that your unscrew.  I am never a fan of removable rubber seal and I have had these seals in water bottle before and eventually they become nasty and horrible, even with regular cleaning.  I had read that somewhere people had experienced leaking with the old style Chute bottle, however I have two and neither have leaked without the rubber seal????  Personally if Camelbak were going to introduce a rubber seal I would have much preferred to see a permanent seal that is integrated into head of the bottle, both for hygiene and ease of cleaning.  Basically a seal that is part of the bottle without any gaps.  These removable seals in the bottle trap water, juice, etc which is not great.  Also Camelback have removed the the rubber on the inside of the bottle holding lope and it is now just hard plastic, which could make for carrying a heavy bottle uncomfortable.  To top it all off the single turn that meant you could get quick access to your drink is now replaced with a full on screw cap, I am not longer able to open this bottle single handed.  Also the magnetic cap is a great idea but the hinge looks to me rather flimsy, so only time will tell on if this lasts.It is still the same solid well made bottle but the cap on the bottle sounds good in theory and certainly the magnetic part is a good idea although the cap on the tether from the previous model never bothered me like it has bothered some folk.  I hate cleaning water bottles and the chute by far has always been the easiest one I have to clean, with these new rubber seals it has now become as painful as the rest.  Some minor improvements but in a bid to try and solve the alleged issues Camelbak have potentially created a whole new set of issues in the process.Still on the fence with the new design but it is still one of my favourite water bottles.</review><review> 'CamelBak products generally have pretty high quality, and the 1.5L/50oz continues with that trend.  There are however several design challenges, which may or may not be applicable to you depending on how you intend to use the bottle.1. It won\'t fit in a cup holder.  Most people buying a water container this large shouldn\'t expect it to.2. It won\'t fit the top rack of your dishwasher.  This one makes less sense, if you don\'t care about the width of the bottle fitting into a standard cup holder, why not make the height low enough that you can fit it into the dishwasher.3. It won\'t fit into your water cooler.  Even with the top off the bottle, it won\'t fit under a standard water cool dispenser, you\'ll need to angle it under the cooler and work on your wrist strength to fill it at work (it also won\'t fit under a bathroom sink faucet).4. The mouth of the bottle is 2".  Just too small to use a canning funnel.  So if you\'re the type of person who uses funnels for protein powder/smoothies, etc.  the top can only fit a standard funnel.  If they\'d made it even a 1/10" wider it would have worked perfectly.  I assume all of their mag tops are a standard width across all their products though.5. It has a raised bottom, like a wine bottle. Only really applicable again to people who are using the bottle for something other than water, but the bottom of the bottle isn\'t flat, so protein powder, pulp, etc. will get stuck in the artificial ridges there.6. You can\'t tell if the top is sealed.  The new mag top is designed in such a way that you can\'t visually tell if the top is closed.  It sits flush with the top even if it\'s not secure. You have to manually check that the cap has been turned completely on the threads, otherwise it will leak out - a lot, it will spill everywhere.7. No measurement markings.  There is one mark for 1,500ml on the bottle, though I\'m not sure if it\'s marking the 1,500ml mark, or just the overall capacity.  If that does mark the 1,500ml mark, it wouldn\'t have cost them anything to also print 250,500,750,1000 indicators, but they didn\'t.Overall, if you\'re just looking for a big water bottle - this will do that job though you can probably find significantly cheaper alternatives of the same quality.  If you\'re considering using this bottle as a gym bottle, or for shakes or protein mixes, I\'d skip it - they unfortunately did not have this use in mind, and the way it was designed will actively frustrate you.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/OneOdio-Wired-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B07WT15ZQF/ref=lp_16225009011_1_4825_cpbg/135-5324050-5527767?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592002&amp;sr=1-4825</link><review> \ 'I do not like head phones as a point. but there is a big but for these headphones.

My husband somehow goes through a bottle of body wash per week, but with this large size bottle, I don't have to change it out as frequently.  For one, the bottle holds a lot of product, and two, the pump dispenses a normal amount of body wash, minimizing the amount my husband uses.

I've used the dove regular moisturizer due to dry skin but purchased that at a local chain store.  I thought it would be great to purchase the larger size that has ultra-moisturizing features.  The first time I used it I thought it was smooth to the skin, but over time I was wondering why this product was not moisturizing the same as the regular one.  When I looked closer at the printing and font of the bottle, it is FAKE FAKE FAKE!!  The font is slightly thicker and the printing of the logo is slightly chipped.

But I needed 25 ft of ethernet cable. I was going to buy two connectors so I could concatanate my three existing cables, but then I decided to find out what I could get from Amazon. When I realized I could get a 25 ft cable for only 70c more than the two connectors, it was no contest.This cable comes in a flat form, nice and white, so it easily goes along my baseboard without looking ugly like those Comcast cables would have. My speed jumped to 4x what it was with 5G wi-fi, and it hasn't dropped my signal yet. Very happy with this product.", "My desktop computer is about 6 meters from the router. Although I get a perfectly fine WiFi signal, for some applications a wired ethernet is necessary.So I looked through Amazon, and this one came up. And it's perfect. The wire is quite thin and white, allowing it to blend in along the baseboards. And this company thoughtfully included nice tacks to hold the wiring in place. The wiring is in a plastic resealable bag inside of a nice box. It looks and feels high quality and high priced. The plugs seem nicely made and should last a long time.So far, it's working perfectly. It was easy to run the wiring along the baseboards. It was an easy 5-minute job. This is a 5-star product.", "It arrived on time.

Cat 6 cable losses no signal at that length which transfer of data really fast.", 'To those who doesnt know the difference between cat 5e to cat 6 is that cat 6 has a thicker gauge of wire but the plug is still the same size. I had to cut the cable today 10 months after i purchased this cable to run it through a wall and planned to crimp a new plug. After stripping the insulation i found the wires a smaller diameter than a true CAT 6 cable. The wires gauge is even SMALLER than a telephone copper wire. This is NOT a CAT 6 cable. The insulation is  even falsely labeled CAT 6. Im dissapointed i got suckered by this seller despite the high review. I trusted the reviews which was a mistake. Now i realized why the only device streaming videos buffers constantly even though i have a 60 mbps internet. I uploaded a photo comparing a real cat 6, telephone wire and this cable.

The new player is smaller and more lightweight than its predecessor.  It's about the size of most recent Sony Blu-ray players.It produces a solid 4K picture that looks like it was from a more expensive player.  The set up is very simple--just choose your language and set up your wireless connection for the basics.  Most of the default settings work fine for most users.The operation is very intuitive.  When the opening screen comes up, press the open/eject button, insert your disc and press PLAY and your done.This 4K player has 2 HDMI outputs--one for audio/video and the second for audio only.  This is very helpful if you are using a receiver with this player.Sony has put the latest video technology into the X700--Dolby Vision.  It produces a more vivid picture with better contrast.  Be advised that this feature does not come out of the box.  You have to update Sony's latest firmware to get this technology that was not available on the previous model, the X800.There are some minor complaints with the X700.  The primary concern is that the included remote is smaller than last year's model.  Good luck using the remote if you have large fingers.  It is nice that the footprint is smaller with the X700, but its light weight can't keep it steady while pressing the open/eject button.  The X700 weighs only just over 3 lbs., while the previous model was 8-1/2 lbs.The Sony UBP-X700 is a solid 4K player.  When it was first released it was priced at $250.  It currently is priced at under $200.  That makes it a great bargain for someone looking for a feature-laden 4K player.", 'Good user interface, great features, and easy to configure. Only complain is the power supply adapter that comes with it. Like most people I put this player into an entertainment center With a power strip in the back to plug all A/V equipment poser cords. That power adapter is so wide that it blocks the adjacent power outlets.</review><review> 'So I stupidly decided to ignore some of the warnings from the others that have purchased this "unit". I have had good luck with Sony over the years and I chose to roll the dice. Well, everything that was reported on other reviews has happened on the unit I received today. First when booting it said there was an update - it went through the update process without issue and eventually it came up to the menu screen (non DVD inserted yet). I started to review the configurations to make sure it was setup correctly for my home theater. During my default menu navigation I noticed the lower half to lower third of the screen flashed white a few times. Next the unit rebooted and came back to the menu screen and it follows this sequence every couple of minutes. I played some Youtube videos and they seemed to play ok however when I inserted a Blu Ray and began to watch my film the unit stopped and rebooted and after 10 seconds or so came right back to where it was on the DVD. This repeated a couple more times and then it finally just froze and went black and by the looks of the display on my Stereo Receiver it simply stopped putting out an audio or video signal. I am going to return this pronto and choose something that works. Goodbye Sony, will miss the old days with you.</review><review> "Locks up every few hours whether I'm watching streaming OTT video or a DVD. It will just randomly freeze on the picture of whatever source I'm watching. The unit is completely unresponsive at that point and only pulling the power cable fixes it. Running the latest firmware. Really hope Sony fixes this soon. I'm past the return window on Amazon.", 'Can&#8217;t go wrong here. It just does what they say it does. The separate audio output is genius. If you&#8217;re not investing in an Atmos sound system just yet, and who is? the separate HDMI port lets you connect to your existing audio. Controls are simple and if your smart tv is up to the task, and whose isn&#8217;t? you can control some functions through the TV remote. PS. Make sure you&#8217;re buying the x-700, the 800 is the older model and does not have the Dolby Vision upgrade (over the internet) and the built in WiFi is a big plus.</review><review> 'Easy setup and works great.

I have always used another camera application and cameras. Ubiquiti released cameras years ago so I decided to try them. At first I had the night vision sensor break on 2 cameras and RMA both times. The early editions also did not work with their POE+ switches. You had to change to 24V passive. Eventually they sorted that out and released new cameras like this one. I thought okay maybe now is the time to try to switch to ubiquiti cameras and the Unifi Protect application to record and view the cameras. But unfortunately I do not believe this is ready for mainstream.The cameras are good. I have no issues with the cameras. They are solid and mount easy and provide clear picture as well as audio.The issue is the Unifi protect software and the support.The software fails to keep a good connection and this is on LAN not even remote. If you would like to view the cameras constantly then do not go the route of Unifi protect. Constant disconnects and reconnects. Streams failing to load. Recent update causes memory leaks in browser and system slows down to a crawl until you close and reopen browser. Its a complete mess. I used a different software before and never had these issues. Currently I am running my old software using the RTSP streams to view my cameras remotely or locally JUST so I don't have to deal with the Unifi protect software. This is in addition to the unifi protect software. I still use it to record for now. But the frustration of having to use another companies software JUST so I can have a clean viewing session is mounting.And then there is the support. They really try, I give them credit there. But I think the problem is they are growing fast and they cant keep up with the support needed. So they just push issues aside and keep the support moving without any real resolution.Summary: Cameras solid build, good video and audio. Software is a complete mess still.

Best buy of 2019 so far!!! Where do I start? Idk, haha, Ok, it looks really pretty and well-made, I love to hold it and watch myself straightening hair in the mirror.I was a bit afraid of lack of review of this product at first, but it looks really nice and covered by warranty, so I cannot resist to click the buy button, and It turns out great!!!It get the job done fast. I have thick hair, so I used to spend more than 1 hour to straight my hair in 8 sections, which was a pain. I have to make up every morning, so my time is very limited, I hate to wake up at 6 am every day, but now I can get up at 7 am, because I only spend about 10 minutes on my hair with this straightener. 50 minutes extra sleep really makes a huge difference, I am able to stay more focused at study in the afternoon when I would usually zone out. This straightener saves my life!!!It also makes my hair looks more natural. I prefer to wear natural looking hair, but flat iron would kill volume and make my hair dead flat. This straightener suits my needs just right, I like the natural shine and silky looking, especially the volume of my hair after using it. My classmate starred at my hair for the whole morning and asked me which salon I went to, I was like, uhhh, home, and she was like, really?? LollllSafety is another feature I care. I don't want be shocked, burn myself or set my house on fire using a hot object. What&#8217;s great about this straightener is its unique design, there is a frame separating the heating core from skin, so it only heats up hair inside the comb and insulated my skin from heat. I use the straightener right on my scalp but I feel nothing. So I can brush my hair in any angle without worrying about burning myself. I give extra credits to this design, great! Love it!!!", 'I have think wavy hair and I hate straightening my hair so, my daughter normally does it for me. I seen a video of someone using this straightener comb and I thought that looks easy, I have to give it a try. Got it today and couldn&#8217;t wait to try it!!! Usually it takes 1 hr to do my hair, I was done with it in 30 mins and I did it all by myself. I&#8217;m very happy and pleased with this straightening comb. Ill probably get my daughter and her best friend one... my hair is straight, smooth and soft after use... love this product!!!!</review><review> 'I really love this iron! I use the second to highest heat setting because I have coarse hair and it straightens it on the first pass!

Had to buy an adapter (US to UK) but had a message from the seller to advise this before receiving.  Came before the expected time and it is a fab product.  Had it on the 3rd temperature setting but by sectioning hair and using the product underneath it got near the root and left my hair so smooth and silky (just like it feels when I have been to the hairdressers). Would 100% recommend this product</review><review> "I never do reviews but I just had to write one for this Tymo straightening comb.I have thick fuzzy hair...a mix of waves and frizz. I can get an amazing smooth, straight effect from good straighteners and using a good serum but after a few hours I get patchy frizziness and waves start to show so if I get a chance I always need to top up with straighteners. I used this Tymo for the first time today and first need to talk about how easy it is to use! I was never goid st fiddling with a comb and straighteners but this was amazing. I sectioned my hair as it recommended and the comb just glided through my hair. After just 1 pass it was silky smooth and perfectly straight! Using it was actually enjoyable....kinda therapeutic! It definitely took less time.But I was thinking...ok after a few hours I'll need to top it up ....but 6 hours later and my hair was still as straight and smooth as when I'd first done it. I'm still in shock at how good these are...I've given my straighteners to another family member as this is now my only straightening tool! I'll never use anything else!I'm in the UK so I didnt need to purchase an adapter for the plug but that was just a few quid and well worth it for this fantastic product.I honestly couldn't recommend it enough!", 'I bought two of these hair brushes as Christmas presents for my daughters.

I ended up doing the full 9 days, but I&#8217;ll explain how I did it at the end. There&#8217;s a trick to this and I wish I would have figured it out before day 3, but better late than never, right? It worked for me personally, but may not stimulate the same results for everyone. I would also like to add that I have healthy teeth that whiten well. Hope this helps!!**before treatment**I lightly brush my teeth with charcoal (3-5 mins). I have a jar of it that I bought here on Amazon for like $4 and it lasts forever. Charcoal helps removes stains from your teeth and removing the stains before will help the gel penetrate more effectively. Ta-da! Rinse your mouth to remove the charcoal (I use warm water because I&#8217;m impatient) and follow that with a good flossing.**time to treat**Seriously just follow the instructions. They are easy to understand and it takes no time at all. Oh and grab a little towel because if you&#8217;re like me you&#8217;ll get slobbery a few minutes before the light turns off and it will feel like eternity. Ha!**after treatment**Brush your teeth with your favorite toothpaste and you&#8217;re done. I use an ultra soft toothbrush when I do this because of the amount of brushing.I split the treatment up a bit because my gums and teeth started to become sensitive around day 6, which is normal for me, so I waited a few days before starting the last 3 treatments. Next time I will do a 5 and 4 split, but of course you can customize it to fit you. Silly me forgot to take a before photo, but I&#8217;ve had plenty of compliments. I started at solid 5 on the tooth chart they provide you, but I am about a 2 or 3 now. That honestly depends on the lighting.I&#8217;ve read a lot of reviews that the light quit working, but I haven&#8217;t had that problem yet. I will find out in a few months when I do this all over again. Overall, I don&#8217;t believe that I would have achieved the results that I did if I hadn&#8217;t of taken the extra steps, but I would probably say the same for any other whitening gel provider. This one was on sale when I purchased it, but still affordable at normal rate. Alone it would have probably gained me 1 shade, however, using the charcoal method alone would have only gained 1 and that one I know for a fact (that&#8217;s why I have the charcoal in the first place). The 2 methods together really made the difference.</review><review> "Update: I have used this about every two weeks for nearly three months...and now it stopped working. After only 3 months! Poorly made product!!Update again: I received a new kit from the company along with a hand written note about how they're trying to fix the issue that I suggested in my previous review. I am VERY impressed with their level of customer service and how they just sent me a new kit without me asking. Great service!I bought this a week ago and couldn't be happier!

I didn't notice much of a difference after my first use but now there is a huge difference between my front teeth and my back teeth that aren't visible anyway. It comes in a nice box that is great for storing the mouth tray and gel syringes. I also like the timer feature on LED accelerator light. Comparing my teeth to the levels on the included chart, I would say that I was between a 9 and 10 before first use and now around a 5 or 6. The tray is comfortable, the gel is easy to rinse off my teeth, and I have not experienced a bit of sensitivity.

I have tried multiple whitening solutions and found MySmile to be gentle, non irritating and was simple to use/not messy. I am looking forward to continuing my use. I was feeling hesitant at first because there are only 3 syringes with the whitening gel... I wasn't quite sure how many uses I would get but I would say each syringe can give you 2-3 whitening applications (this is accounting for both bottom and top teeth).All in all... so far so good!

All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus.UPDATE: 4/7/2018.  The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer.2nd UPDATE: I didn't  realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&amp;T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&amp;T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&amp;T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&amp;T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&amp;T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&amp;T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&amp;T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely.4th UPDATE April 23, 2018As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.", 'great phone but a few problems and some thing you need to clear up and be more clear about when i got the phone it was not sealed and when i took it to get it actived i was told it was used other then that everything seems to be in the box and works just fine but you need to let ppl know these phones have been opened</review><review> "MetroPCS initially had issues getting it added to my account, but I woke up the next morning and it was working fine.

I got this set of adapters to give them a try.  The results were great!  They work with both the iPad Pro  and MacBook Pro with my pair of older, but decent corded Sennheiser over ear headphones.  Just plug them in and fire up the audio, no drivers or any fiddling with settings needed.  The sound quality for music was really good - something I attribute to the built-in DAC used.  I also liked that there is a green LED that lights up when the USB-C is inserted properly, so you know you have a good connection to your audio source.  I've only had them a couple days, so I can't tell how long they would stand up to the rigors of everyday use, but they seem very well built.  Obviously, these adapters serve a specific niche need - but if you have the need, you can't go wrong with these!", 'I have had a note 10 for about 5 months now, and the lack of a 3.5mm headphone port has been driving me crazy.  Samsung does not include an adapter for any 3.5mm headphone to be converted to Type-C, and the Note 10 requires a digital converter ( I have 3 type-c converter that does not work because of this)This set of 2 3.5mm to Type-C converter works perfectly on the Note 10, and now I can simply carry my old sets of 3.5mm headphone and be ready for either the Type-C port or a 3.5mm headphone port.Highly recommended to save yourself from owning a new stockpile of headphones.</review><review> 'Alright, when I purchased this, I figured I would give it a week or so along with traveling to test between the regular earphone jack and this dongle on the TAB A &amp; S9+.  On the S9+, I went between the two and I have to say, this device improves the low end and makes the music sound "Cleaner" then just using the jack.  To be fair, it was tested on the AKG Samsung earplugs which are not bad, but middle of the road.  When I used it on the Tab A for inflight movies, again, the sound was more "rich" and better low end using sam earplugs.  So I do have to say, if you are looking for an inexpensive way to upgrade the sound of your wired headphones/earplugs on at least the Samsung series of devices, these will do the job and do it well.  Very much worth the small investment.</review><review> 'I am a consumer who subscribes to Amazon Prime. It stated that my order would be here on the 28th of the month but it came one day later. This was not a big deal and was understandable as I live quite far outside of the city. I have used one of the two adopters extensively and it functions perfectly, it fits into the USB type-c port and headphone jack perfectly and at any volume there was no cutout of sound or drop of connection or any funny sounds due to bad circuitry or poor craftsmanship. I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend this item to anyone who needs the product I am reviewing here. It is a great price and I am extremely happy with the product so far. Thank you very much for the positive and fair buy and sell situation and I would definitely buy from this seller in the future for any of my needs that he or she may have to sell to me. Great job, you have one super happy customer and the one-day delay was not due to the seller in any way.</review><review> "I was so upset when I found out my new S20 didn't have a headphone jack!

Well packaged and had it assembled 100% within 15 minutes. So easy. I bought this telescope as a gift for my son. He is so excited.

But today, I was so surprised, the moon is very easy to find. it's big and bright. The moon is moving very fast and you will have to adjust the angle slightly after a while. After watching the moon, I also can see several bright starts next to it. With my help, my little son has started to have more interest on astronomy. I am so glad that I have made a perfect choice with this telescope. it has amazing quality Really highly recommended.", "This is a well made Telescope.It comes with a bag that is a good to carry. Assembly is not very simple but easy enough.Finder scope is very much needed and the once everything is setup the Mobile holder is the best thing to have.Note: You can only expect to view objects as far as Moon.

However it wasn&#8217;t until two months later that the third of four toner cartridges started reporting low toner. None of them had run out. Then I put the four new toner cartridges in, except the cyan cartridge was not recognized by the printer. I called Canon and they said it must have a defective electronic activation mechanism in the cartridge. And get this, Canon would NOT replace the BRAND NEW, genuine defective Canon toner cartridge. And Amazon&#8217;s 30-day return window had run out. To say the least,  I was a very, very dissatisfied Canon customer.  Fortunately Amazon caved and agreed to give me a refund of most of what that cartridge cost.  Amazon would not just exchange it for a replacement cyan cartridge that works.I do not know how big of a quality problem Canon has, but this experience is going to change how I buy replacement toner cartridges, because I cannot trust Canon&#8217;s quality. You can tell the printer to keep printing and ignore the low toner warnings until it really starts to affect print quality. And all away down at 1%, there was no effect on print quality.  In the future I will wait until I get down to 1% before I order any one toner cartridge.I do not know why Canon has such a customer-unfriendly policy. You pay a premium price for a supposedly premium product and they sell you something totally defective, and they won&#8217;t replace it.The one-star rating is for the first of two cyan toner cartridges from Canton being totally defective, combined with Canon&#8217;s customer unfriendly policy.

Unless you have sworn off all electricity and telecommunications, you most likely have to deal with cords/cables. Nothing is more annoying than when they are messy, and this can in some cases present a tripping hazard. Rubber bands, wire ties, traditional zip ties, strong, and tape can all be used for this purpose, but they all have their downsides (some of which are significant.)Here, we have a cord/cable tie that uses a removable &amp; reusable hook-and-loop fabric fastener produced by the Velcro brand, a name synonymous with hook-and-loop fasteners. Vastly different from the other options listed above, it is easy to apply, easy to remove, does not cause damage to cords/cables, does not rapidly degrade with age, can easily be cut (or combined) to change the size for the User's needs, and works well even when being used frequently.You have likely seen similar products at hardware stores, but generally the quantity per-package is low, and the price high. That limits practicality if you have a lot of cords. But here you can get 100 Velcro ties for about 6 bucks. Made with both economy &amp; performance in mind, these wraps are lighter duty than some other Velcro products offered, and are only available in a black color. They measure 8 inches long and 1/2 inch wide, so they work well with most standard-sized cords (for larger cords, just connect two or more through the loops to form a single giant cord tie.) Each individual tie has a hole punched into one end, which allows the user to loop &amp; tighten the tie to a cord/device so that the tie does not fall off of the cord when completely unstrapped/opened up.What I wanted was a versatile, durable, removable, reusable, and affordable cord/cable tie...these fit those needs perfectly. They are well made, reasonably strong, and the Velcro fastener used is very good quality considering the price. While these are lighter duty than most of the retail packages of Velcro Cord Ties are, these work perfectly for my general home-use needs and they cost about 1/10th the price.So I highly recommend these Velcro cord/cable ties!", 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0The package comes in 4 rolls of 25 velcro. The first piece of the roll is always an extra cut of strap to "close" the roll. The Velcro is made of one piece with both parts on each side, not glued together but 1 piece of fabric. The Velcro is very small. It is somewhat easy to separate the pieces if you pull opposite from each other, like separating book pages. However, pulling the velcro on opposite end on the same plan, like pulling on each end of a rope, is quite solid. It is usefull to replace zip ties and twisties. They are 8 in. long. They are long enough for most small cords you need to tie, but sometimes I wished they were a bit longer to go around power supplies and extension cables. It is possible to combine 2 pieces together to create a longer cable tie though. Don\'t use it as a "hanger". The weight of the cord will unroll the velcro. What is interesting is it is easy to separate if you pull in a way, and super strong in the other way. You need to remove the little hole piece yourself (Wraps Onto Itself). You can end up will lots of annoying small black pieces around. The problem with velcro is when dusts gets into it. The velcro is so small that dusts don\'t really get caught and I didn\'t really had any issues in that regard. Worst case, you have plenty of velcro strap to replace 1 if needed. The end where it folds onto itself could be better. I have seen other "wraps onto itself" shape that seems to hold better. However, the ties still won\'t go anywhere I some have state that they don\'t know how long it will hold before it brakes. I think it will hold for quite some time if you look at my video.</review><review> 'These are better than the Monoprice ones (which up until how had been my favourite).If you\'ve ever used the green Velcro brand reel of plant-tie, these are the same basic material as that, but in black and shaped as fixed length "loop-around" cable ties. It\'s about 1mm thick, the loop side is more "velvet" than "fluffy" and the hook side isn\'t so scratchy compared with regular velcro (or other hook+loop).They\'re not so heavy-duty, but being thinner and more flexible makes them pretty convenient to use. The extra length (8 inches, rather than 6 on monos) makes them great for bundling thicker mains cables.I\'m going to re-wrap my mains cables with these, and probably swap the ties on my other cables (audio and DMX) over time.</review><review> "I use these Velcro stywle tie wraps all the time and have already used over 200??  Yes, I know that sounds excessive but it's surprising the number of ways I've used these.  I've given some away but every lead on the AV system, TV, various game boxes, computers all have tidy leads.  If there is a lead its got a neat cable tie.Where the supplied lead is too short I've connected two together by looping one through the other, in that way I can extend these to quite long lengths.", "Excellent value and have used them to tidy up cables everywhere in the house. We are constantly moving things about, which invariably means needing to tidy up cables in bedrooms, living room etc. These cable ties are easy to use, can be removed and reused without issue. They do not tie extremely tight (unlike a traditional plastic cable tie), so don't use them where you need once cable to be anchored tightly to another, but fine for tying a cable to a tv stand leg or for bunching cables together. I would definitely buy again, but still have half a pack left, so probably wont need to for many years", 'The Velcro ties have turned out to be incredibly useful and I use them to keep everything neat and tidy. I though that 100 would last me ages but I have already used about half of them up. They can also be used for holding other small items together but are not particularly strong.The bag they came in got a bit annoying - it seals using Velcro, that sticks to the cable ties when you take them in or out!

Either because I&#8217;m going out in the evening, and want to take a pic of my outfit; or because the only time I have to make my videos is when my kiddos are in bed.For this reason, this product was a life (or hobby) saver to me.1- Tripod: pretty standard, but I LOVE THAT IT IS DUAL, and it can hold 2 phones. So I record my videos with one phone filming a close up of my face, and the other recording whole body. It&#8217;s soooo much easier to edit later.2- Ring Light: just AWESOME!! It lights up my face or video in such a neutral and beautiful way, I don&#8217;t need to be editing and using filters later. Photo quality looks more professional for sure; to do the videos sometimes it&#8217;s a little distracting, since I have to read chords for some music; it&#8217;s too bright, but I still giving 5 stars because it does its job very well, and I can easily turn it off, if it&#8217;s bothering me.

While the 12" bulb doesn\'t compare to an 18" we purchased from a different brand, they are just as intense in terms of brightness. With different lighting shades and a brightness slider, the selfie ring light is versatile.In terms of portability, which was important to us, the ring light comes with a travelling bag for the tripod, but unfortunately, no cover for the bulb. However, for the price, this is acceptable. We purchased a different ring light that came with a bag for everything, but it was also double the cost.The device is powered through a USB cable, which may not be a good idea if you plan on using this far from any wall plugs or devices with a USB port. However, chances are, you will, so this isn\'t a big issue. Moreover, your mounted devices may be controlled via a shutter remote that is included with the ring light.Overall, while its size is small, the ring light packs a punch. With high-quality materials in its tripod and bulb, we were pleased with the quality of the shots and videos taken with this device.

I decided to get a 3rd camera at the back of the house as we once had an intruder wandering around our conservatory.The camera arrived next day. Installation was simple. I used my own rawl plugs though as they are a little tougher and necessary for my walls. The camera and solar charger were both easy to fit.I have used the required Cloudedge app before so was familiar with the functions. Adding this extra camera was incredibly simple. I just had to hold a code in front of the camera and it was registered. I can now see both the front and rear camera in one app which is a big bonus. The app is free and notifies me when there has been movement detected. Ive fitted a 32gb memory card to play back short video recordings too.I&#8217;m happy with the video and photo quality and does what I&#8217;d expect for the price.I have installed the solar charger too but as I live up North it will be interesting to see how effective it is. I can only really test this after a few moths of use. My other camera (with no solar charger) has lasted 3 months so far and still hasn&#8217;t needed to be charged. I would there expect this to last much longer still.Overall a great product and whether or not you want the solar charger is up to you, depending upon whether or not you want to take the camera down every few months to charge it.</review><review> 'I&#8217;ve always wanted to add some security to the back of my house but due to constraints of getting electrics to the back of my house this has always put me off the idea but when I came across this product I knew I&#8217;ve found the best solution.Most CCTV cameras require cables to carry the signal or at least to be powered on and for DIY installation that could be quite a problem.The issue is even greater if power is not available in the first place like in the garden or a garage shed etc now with a solar panel as long as I have sun I can charge the batteries.This camera feels sturdy and well built, the power is provided by 10400mAh rechargeable batteries the main unit has a much greater battery back up than most of the competitors.The image quality is pretty good and surely more than adequate for my needs the App installation is really straightforward and the instruction provided are really easy to follow and very clear.From start to finish it took me about 5 minutes to have the software running and the camera showing up on my phone all App options are also easy to control and the camera appear to have a very strong and reliable WiFi signal.I have used it for about a week and the battery still has 93%. I used a micro SD card for video storage.The motion detection is very sensitive It will send notification to your phone once the camera detects something moving in front of its range both day and night vision.At the same time, it starts to record everything it captures and stores those video in the SD card night vision impressed me greatly it was very clear.What this camera offers is convenience for the buyer you do not need a installer as it can be done by yourself if you are confident you won&#8217;t need electricity so low cost running.This product has helped me add security to the corners of the house which I may have never ever thought off so really satisfied with this purchase great value for the money it cost I can&#8217;t recommend this camera enough.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RLLNKP1/ref=lp_16225009011_1_6881_twi_col_ti_2/135-9149296-4033925?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592721&amp;sr=1-6881</link><review> \ 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0Definitely love these</review><review> 'I recently purchased a new pair of Geekee True Wireless Earbuds on Amazon. At first glance the charging box felt a little cheap, but the earbuds seemed well constructed. After extended use, the headphones held a long charge. They also did not seem to be impacted by sweat when I wore them during workouts.The noise canceling feature is nice and lets me concentrate during a workout without having to listen to the gym&#8217;s music choices. One of the factors I like best about this set is that the earbuds have a stabilizer. With other earbuds I had tried before they did not have a stabilizer and I would consistently drop an earbud, especially when used in any vigorous activities. The stabilizer keeps the Geekee buds in my ears throughout my entire workout, even when sweating and if I need to bend down or run.The Bluetooth connects quickly as soon as they are turned on and the sound quality has been good. For work I often throw in a single earbud to get through long shifts and this also extends the battery life I am able to expect from a single charge of the carrying case.I have not had them long enough to know true long term durability but as of now it looks very promising. For $50 this is a great set of headphones that can be used for an active lifestyle.</review><review> "I enjoy using these ear buds.

It is much more transparent/clear than I expected, and it frames the phone very nicely. It feels quite sturdy, enough so to stop me from worrying about potential cracks. Honestly looks like you don't have a screen protector on the phone due to how transparent it is. I am satisfied with this product and it exceeded my expectations, especially when considering that other screen protectors, for the same price, are not as sturdy. Also a lot of things are included besides the screen protector, it even comes in a separate 'accessory' package that includes wet wipes, dry wipes, and a microfiber cloth. My only complaint is that I thought the 'dust absorber' would be more than a sticker but I'm honestly reaching for negatives at this point. All in All, its a great bundle of items and I'm pretty satisfied with the items included.", '3 pack of screen protectors is great value. Installation frame makes the process flawless and extremely easy. The adhesive on the screen protector practically installs itself as soon as it is dropped in place on the phone screen.No air bubbles. Perfect. Highly recommend.</review><review> "Got this for my iPhone 12 and compared to all the other glass screen protectors I've had to install and experiment, I'd say this was one of the easiest installations ever. The glass is not super thick, but fits exactly across the screen perfectly fine. The screen also reflects clearly after installation. There are also no bubbles, which is a big thing for me since I've had to deal with ones where the bubbles just couldn't be removed. If you get any on the sides when you first install, just smooth it out and it will go away really quickly.It also comes with a wet cloth, cloth to wipe the screen and the dust stickers so all you need in the package. There's also spares in case your screen protector breaks :)", 'Using the included moist wipe, microfiber cloth, dust sticker, and guide tray (a must!), installation was a breeze -- not a single bubble or speck of dust to be found. Touch sensitivity is flawless. Highly recommended!</review><review> 'The plastic guide fit my iPhone 12 well, and the screen protector went on without a hitch! Touch screen responds perfectly. Except for the upper notch, it does cover the screen almost right up to the edge, including the bezel area. So if you have a case that extends over that area, you may encounter a problem. Fortunately, my case is pretty minimalist, so no issue there.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/HP-Cartridge-CH561WN-Cartridges-CZ073FN/dp/B004ZOT5KS/ref=lp_16225009011_1_690/135-7843168-4724720?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605590581&amp;sr=1-690#customerReviews</link><review> \ "We ordered a two pack.

I would have preferred it been on the front of the keyboard. The real pain point with this combo is the mouse.

Does your controller touch pad in the middle make  a loud clicking sound uppon pressing down? If Yes then its a fake, original ps4 controllers have a smooth soft click when pushing down the touch pad2. Original controllers always have an orangy yellowy light turning on and off when charging.. ALWAYS, unless its fully charge. If uppon chargung your controller the light turns orange or yellow then turns off and doesnt keep repeating the process but it is still charging while there is no light to indicate that the controller is charging then its definitely a fake. If you are not to sure, make sure there is only 0,1, or 2 bars left before charging because some controller wont charge if they are at 3 full bars and wont go down a bar untill an hour or 2 pass by depending on the vibration and button movement. To check battery status you can just press and hold the playstation button down.3. And one of my favorites is when you turn on your controller keep an eyes on the light in back of your controller as it lids ups, should take a second or 2 to fully turn on. If it flickers when the light is turning on or the light lags or looks like it struggled to turn fully on, it is 100% fake. Easiest way to spot a counterfit.4. Only for the super fake ones the sony sticker on the back of the controller will not be straight or the sticker on the back is already pealing off on its own.There are other ways to find out if dualshocks are fake but you have to have a little more experiance with fake controllers, if you do have experiance here are some extras in case you dis not know. Make sure your buttons are not sticking out to much and make sure the PS button is not a little off or the texture of the controller is off.

After working extensively with Razer support (who have been great) and two replaced controller it was finally determined to be a firmware bug as predicted. They issued a new firmware v1.02.00 which fixes the issue . So if you experience the audio bug I faced you should contact Razer support to get the firmware updater . I now full, 200% recommend this controller . The only reason I am not bumping my original rating from 4 stars is to recognize the existence of this initial (but resolved) issue I'm an avid console FPS gaming enthusiast and spend a significant portion of my game time playing online competitive multiplayer games like Titanfall 2, Battlefield 1 ,  Overwatch, Halo 5 etc. And just like me I'm sure you will come to a point where you'll realize that the stock OEM Xbox controller doesn't really cut it. Hence I have a amassed quite the collection of 3rd party controllers including my current favourite the Razer Wildcat controller  (before using the Wolverine controller that is). For this review I will compare the new Wolverine controller to the Wildcat controller, how it feels in hand while gaming and reasons why I had initially chosen the Razer Wildcat over the Xbox Elite controller ( all of which apply to the Wolverine controller as well)WHY I CHOOSE THE RAZER CONTROLLER OVER THE XBOX ELITE CONTROLLERWhen I first purchased my Wildcat I had spent an embarrassingly large amount of time researching between it and the Elite controller and in the end it came down to this :- If you read online forums, Reddit etc you'll quickly come to realize that the Elite controller is plagued with build quality issues and cheap plastic parts that break easily and on top of that the elite controller only has a 6 month warranty. These Razer controllers come with 1 year warranty. To me the the length of  warranty told me all I wanted to know about the confidence each of the manufacturer had in their product- The second thing that really seals the deal in favor of the Razer controllers (both Wildcat &amp; Wolverine) is MECHANICAL buttons - You see even while costing $150 the elite controller had the same rubber domed ABXY buttons as the stock Xbox or any other cheap controllers. Rubber dome buttons do not provide the right feedback while intense gameplay as they tend to bottom out / fade away and 'stick' over time . Whereas the Razer controller feature proper mechanical switch ABXY buttons that are responsive , Clicky (just like a mechanical keyboard) and  feature a very short travel distance and actuation time- Well these two reasons were more than enough for me to look away from the elite controllerDESIGN &amp;  BUILD QUALITY- From the first moment you unbox the Wolverine controller , open its velvet lined hardshell case and hold the controller in your hand - you realize that it just oozes with quality worthy of its asking price. It is neither too heavy nor too light , the matte finish plastic construction, triggers , trigger locks all feel solid and operate smoothly without any creaks and rattles- Unlike the Razer Wildcat controller where you have to stick the rubberized grips yourself which is hard to get right , the Wolverine controller now features a permanent rubberized dotted grip which works out much better in practice without adding too much bulk. It is very comfortable to hold/squeeze even with sweaty palms- The trigger stops are also better built and feel sturdier than Razer Wildcat controller- The four rear buttons on the rear of the controller ( M3 to M6) are made of plastic and are also of the mechanical switch type with very short actuation distance and clicky operation. One thing I would like to point out is that the rear triggers/buttons on the Wildcat controller are made of metal whereas they have switched to plastics for the new Wolverine controller- Another aspect where the Razer controllers are better than the Elite controller is their built in chat &amp; program pad. You can quickly program the 6 customizable buttons without the help of any software and  quickly change assignments on the fly . It can store two profile assignments and also adjust chat and game volume-  You can swap the rubber domed metal- thumbsticks , D-pad out to match your preference whether you like the stock xbox controller feel, taller wider or dome shaped thumbsticks - there's one for every preference. While the magnets that hold the thumbsticks and D-pad is strong they can still come out if the controller falls or is kept face down . Hence i would recommend some caution there-  The reason why most of the 3rd party controllers on the market today are wired (with the sole exception of modded stock $170+ Scuff controllers) is because Xbox One uses a proprietary wireless protocol for their controllers which is probably very expensive to license, so its hard to be critical on this controller for being wired. Having said that the included 10 Ft nylon braided cable is durable and long enough for most gaming setups and can easily reach your couchPERFORMANCE, TRIGGER LOCKS &amp; CUSTOM BUTTONS- Lets first talk about the trigger locks as they're one of main game changers when compared to stock controllers, as they limit the motion of the RT/LT triggers right upto their actuation point and cutting their 'dead' zone by almost 75%. If you prefer high precision or semi-automatic weapons in your FPS games, then you can get in significantly more number of shots faster than you would on a regular controller. The importance of that in a tense encounter with another player cannot be understated. Also unlike the Wildcat controller you dont have to activate a special 'Hair Trigger' mode on this controller as some games do not accurately recognize trigger locks . The Wolverine controller does that automatically the moment you engage the trigger locks. Very convenient indeed- The positioning for the additional shoulder buttons M1 &amp; M2 is genius if you ask me and once you get used it , you will stop using the regular shoulder buttons LB &amp; RB . That's because when your fingers are on the LT &amp; RT fingers are already exactly where  the shoulder M1 &amp; M2 buttons are located . That way you can operate them without having to lift your fingers off the triggers - Another advantage in multiplayer- The four buttons at the back M3 to M6 are ideally located and easy to reach , but it does take getting some used to for incorporating into your gameplay. But the thing is once you get used to it you cant do away with it - I find it very hard going back even to my Wildcat controller now!- By default the rear triggers M5 &amp; M6 are configured for  two modes with the left rear trigger for a mode called 'Focus' which decreases the sensitivity of the  analog sticks by half as long as you keep M5 pressed (you can fine tune this in the Xbox Synapse app) . This allows you to carefully line up those headshots using sniper rifles . Pressing the right rear trigger activates the 'Agile' mode which doubles the analog stick sensitivity for faster response. Once you get the hang using these two mode - It does give you yet another very tangible advantage over your opponent- Of Course if you dont want to use the Focus &amp; Agile modes you can always re-assign the rear triggers  M5 &amp; M6 to any button you like. Think of of it - With the four rear buttons you could map the entire ABXY buttons to them and never have to move your fingers off the thumbsticks and the triggers ! ( as even the shoulder buttons M1 &amp; M2 are right there)- Now for the Chroma lighting on the controller which I first thought was mainly gimmicky as you never get to see it  while you are actually gaming - But it does look cool for onlookers. What changed my view of it was a lighting mode called 'Immersive' which lights up as according to the controller's vibrations ie say when you fire a weapon it lights up or when you are running . It does look very cool- Check out the small clip i made of it in actionAN ANNOYING BUG- My only disappointment with this controller is a firmware bug I encountered where if you use the Wolverine to turn on the Xbox it does not activate the audio on the 3.5mm jack  and you have to do literally unplug the controller and plug the controller back in to get audio. Sometimes even the controller fails to turn on when you power on the Xbox- I contacted Razer support for this and they did RMA my first controller and since they did not have one in stock in their local warehouse they sent it to me from their Hong Kong warehouse with two day international shipping ! Kudos to them for that but even my second controller has the same issue.- I am decking one star for this bug alone. And the reason why I am not taking away more stars is because it can be fixed via a firmware update (which just happens to not be available yet) and they had the other similar issues with their Wildcat controller at launch which was fixed by a later firmware upgrade. I just hope it comes soon enough- I have the original Xbox  (not the S) and this bug happens on Xbox on both power saving and instant on modesFINAL THOUGHTSSo there you have it the Wolverine controller is miles better than their own Wildcat controller (and by extension the Xbox Elite controller) . It is so good that I dont like using my Wildcat anymore as it does give a very tangible edge to my gameplay and has better overall ergonomics and precision. The only thing I would like to caution you about is the audio bug I faced requiring you to unplug and replug the controller every time. I will update this review once there is a firmware update available but until then you'll have to decide if its a quirk worth living with or not.

Tomar en cuenta adem&#225;s que no hay opciones para llamar en espa&#241;ol, por lo que si no lo hablas muy bien, te vas a topar con un enorme problema.Una vez que me contact&#233; con ellos, me hicieron mandar mi prueba de compra, mis datos personales y un video que demostrara el problema (una pesadilla para quienes no sabemos editar videos). Enviados los datos me comentaron que con gusto me cambiaban el control, pero que no hacen env&#237;os a M&#233;xico. Por tanto lo que ten&#237;a que hacer era mandar mi control a alg&#250;n amigo o familiar en EUA, que esa persona lo enviara a Razer (sin costo los env&#237;os dentro de EUA) y ellos le enviar&#237;an uno nuevo o reparado que despu&#233;s mi contacto me podr&#237;a enviar a M&#233;xico.Revis&#233; costos de env&#237;o desde el centro del pa&#237;s a Arizona y descubr&#237; que de enviar mi control viejo y recibir el nuevo ten&#237;a que erogar aproximadamente $3,000.00 MXN cuando el control lo compr&#233; en $3,3350.00 MXN (en oferta), sin contar todo el tiempo que no iba a tener mi control para jugar.En fin, si te gust&#243; el control y no tienes problema con la imposibilidad de repararlo si presenta fallas adelante, repito, el control es excelente.Espero les sirva mi review amigos.</review><review> "I had the Xboxone Elite before .

Don&#8217;t get me wrong It&#8217;s always is good to hear positive reviews but I like to convince myself first by doing what so many people don&#8217;t like to do and that&#8217;s spend time and get to know what your buying.Battery life was also holding up very well on rechargeable battery&#8217;s and It would give you at lest 6 hours with no problems. I always keep extra battery on side  no matter how well the battery will perform. I have not put the radio in water wet test that&#8217;s because even when radio is mentioned it&#8217;s somewhat water resistant I all ways protect my electronics from getting wet.

Having said that, I roll my boat every time I go out and paddle in rough ocean surf all the time so I'm much harder on the radio than the average customer.Based on poor reports about customer service, I wasn't optimistic when I tried to contact them for warranty support. In fact, the first time I tried, I couldn't get through. However, when I tried on another day, I got through to a live person within 2 minutes and they quickly determined I needed to send it in for a warranty repair. They replaced my radio with a reconditioned in better shape than the one I sent so I was satisfied.I managed to kill the replacement radio they sent me after about 8 months. It survived many rolls as well as a number of swims, but it died died following a longer than normal swim during rescue practice.This radios will be very good for people who simply go out in wet conditions, and it's fine for an occasional dunking.

The brake pedal is much improved over non load cell pedals from Thrustmaster and i foresee much more consistent lap times in my future.I'd definitely recommend these to anyone from beginner to seasoned vet. For those semi serious sim racers who can only spend $100-$200 on pedals, these are the very best pedal set on the market i believe.", "Had these delivered today. Can't even describe how excited I am for Thrustmaster to release such high quality affordable load cell pedals. Compared to other load cells, these are much cheaper in cost, but the quality is definitely there.Right out of the box I could feel the difference. Compared to the default pedals shipped with my TS-XW wheel, these are substantially heavier and sturdier. The base is wide to prevent your feet slipping off the edge during driving regardless of using socks or shoes.Setup is a breeze. Plugging directly into a USB slot on my PC, the software was downloaded quickly and everything calibrated instantly.The difference in driving is night and day. Using me regular style of braking, I was only able to get to around 50% brake pressure through the load cell. I quickly adjusted the springs, which is painless and easy. I think the design of the adjustable springs in the brake pedal is the biggest surprise for me. It is a quick easy adjustment. Taking seconds to swap out. I can definitely see myself adjusting on the fly between cars.All in all I am blown away by these pedals. Absolutely worth the wait.", "Finally a set of Load Cell Pedals from Thrustmaster! And they are actually very good and well thought out for the money.  Having upgraded from the T3PA Pro's I can say that I am really happy with how they feel.  But they do need the Apex Racing Mod to really make them better, as even the strongest spring combinations is a bit on the soft side and you can bottom the brake pedal out under heavy braking which feels unrealistic.  If you have the T3PA's, T3PA Pro's either stock or mod'ed with a 3rd Party Load Cell.  I still think the TLCM Pedals feel better, and I have tried almost all the mods for the T3PA Pro's.  Its a shame that they were not full metal construction like the Pro's but don't let that put you off.If you need or want to keep within the Thrustmaster Eco-System such as on console then they are the best pedals available from Thrustmaster.  If you are happy to mix and match, are on PC or using a Drive Hub on Console, then there are probably better Load Cell Pedals available but not at the same price point.", "Wow, what a difference a load cell makes. I've used a conical brake mod for a couple of years now and got on quite well with it, HOWEVER the feel and modulation in a load cell is unparalleled. What a job by Thrustmaster.

The stand holds it perfectly! It's adjusted to slightly less than a 90 degree angle so there isn't a risk of my tablet toppling over, but the angle is close enough to 90 degrees so viewing my tablet like a monitor is comfortable.

It looks like something NASA would have designed. High quality materials and very functional. It is stiff to adjust but for me that's an advantage as there is no danger of the thing folding when you are using it. Because I'm paranoid about my electronics I added a little security to it, I took two 3M Command hooks, drilled a hole in them and connected them with a suitable length rubber band.

Used auto scan mode and it discovered the device! I can only assume I got lucky. The lights are very bright and work well with Alexa integration.

Split blue/red is always my favorite while you can add a hint of green or blue with one of the panels.It comes with the wireless remote, tripod mount with cold shoe, nice padded case and phone &amp; tablet holder as well as a compact tripod that folds for easy travel.  A/C wall adapter is included as well.While the other version is cheaper, I would say this is best bang for the buck with all the items included with the freedom of using batteries.  You\'ll want the large capacity "NP-F970" batteries here on Amazon.  You can get two (which is needed to run this light) with a charger for under $50.The ring of course is large enough to even have two people seen inside the ring side by side.  The light is very diffused to it does not create a harsh shadow either.  The freedom of wireless remote as well as full control from the back panel is always handy.This was definitely worth the buy and highly recommend it for vloggers, YouTubers and would be bright enough to light a small room!</review><review> "This is a far cry from a professional ring light but unless you need accurate color temperature, precise luminosity control and a rugged pro build this light will get most jobs done.

The screen is also now a AMOLED display which means it will provide an ample amount of brightness and great sharp colours in the great outdoors (compared to the LED model of Versa 1).BUTTONSIf you were a fan of the three button system the old Versa has, then look away. Now you have to rely more on the swipes and taps on the bigger screen to navigate. I rather like this more polished look as it becomes sleeker in my view but not everyone may have this opinion.OSThe OS has some new tweaks like a dashboard which enables you to set night mode, do not disturb, brightness and whether you have a screen that wakes on movement or manually. This is quick useful as in the past it took a few more taps and was more clumsy of a process. Overall i have found over the years the Fitbit sleep tracking and exercise tracking to be fun to use and best in class compared to other trackers. The new sleep score system puts all the information together to give you a singular number to compare you sleep on a daily basis.SPEEDThe Fitbit Versa 2 is much snappier thanks to the upgraded internals. Whilst scrolling through, you can tell the touch response to the screen is much quicker than the prior generation.COMPATIBILITYThe Fitbit Versa 2 has a new charger hub, which means you can't use the old Versa 1 charging cable. Fitbit loves making new products that aren't compatible with old chargers. Whilst this is disappointing, at least the Versa 1 straps are backward compatible with Versa 2. So at least you have that. The watch faces are also compatible vs the older Versa, so there is already a massive existing library for you to customise your experience.NEW FEATURESThere aren't really that many new features compared to the Fitbit Versa 1. The main addition worth mentioning is really just Alexa capabilities. Unfortunately i found out that you need to keep the Fitbit app open in the background. It seems to have no problem picking up what I am saying. I have found Alexa to be a bit of a gimmick as the connection is not always reliable. It often tells me that there is no internet connection or the app isn't open and therefore Alexa doesn't work.BATTERY LIFEAccording to the specifications the battery life is supposed to last 5 days. This is 1 more than the old model. After a year with the old Versa, it seemed to decrease in battery life, but this is expected with older devices. I will update in this review once I can put it to the full test. However, Fitbit over the years has lived up to the specifications on every device i have owned (except of course if it is defective). I would expect it to last the full 5 days as advertised. This is far longer than many of Fitbits competitors out there.SHOULD YOU GET IT?If you already own a Versa, and it still works fine, then no - probably not. But if you have a defective or bashed up old on, then you might consider the upgrade. I think given the unreliability of Alexa and connectivity being required to access these smart features, it loses 2 stars for me. However, this is hopefully a software update away from being far far better. I will update this review should anything change.If you are a newbie to Fitbit, then I do think this is a good starter to get into the Smartwatch/fitness watch game. It is less smart than some of the competitors out there like Apple Watch and even the Garmins, but it does what it says on the tin, is reliable and at the end of the day a household name ecosystem that many of your friends will be part of.UPDATE: After 6 days of using, the battery is still at 32%. Fitbit has outdone themselves with the battery life. The connectivity problems with Alexa are still intermittent, but i have found it to be slightly more reliable than when i started. I also found the resting heart rate sensor to be quite different from the Versa 1. I will continue to monitor, as it hasn't changed as much as it usually does in a 1 week period with my Versa 1.", "Pre-ordered this and delivery was on time.In the box you get the watch, charger, and some straps. There's also an instruction pamphlet, but it's pretty basic. To get started properly you need to download the Fitbit app, after which the app will take you through the installation process. Be warned that there will most likely be a firmware update to go through first, so you need to have the Fitbit on charge.So the charging cable is a custom USB cable purely for the Fitbit. An industry standard cable would have been better - just one less cable to manage.The watch is easy to use. I suggest buying a custom clock face (you can do this via the app. The custom clock faces provide a lot more info). There's a lot of customisation you can do. I have the display set to off, and the watch will switch on the display if you make the action with your wrist to look at the watch (not 100% perfect though).Battery life looks to be very good. I've used the watch extensively for a 24 hour period so far, and the battery is at 84%.Edit: the battery life is awesome. I charge it once a week, even then I reckon I could get a couple more days out of the existing charge.The biggest negative for me is that the watch can sense when your exercising and start to log the activity. Only problem is that is works for some exercise types only e.g. it didn't work for when I did weight training. You do have the option to manually add the activity, or start it via the watch, but given the price of this watch it should log automatically.The other issue I found is with the app. Some clock faces require an activation code. This can only be done via clock face settings in the app, which isn't yet supported for the Versa 2. Edit: this is now fixed.Another issue I found with the app is that it doesn't log a walk properly when using GPS. I stress this is an issue with the app and not watch. What happens is the app starts to log, and then at some random point stops logging using GPS, but still provides the correct statistics, only that according to the GPS part of the stats the walk ended long before it did.I'll update this review as I delve more into the features of this watch.Edit: The watch records your sleeping heart rate, but Fitbit charge a premium for you to see YOUR data. Not impressed. That's one star knocked off", 'Es gibt wenig Dinge, die so einfach sind, wie diese Uhr zu installieren und mit dem Handy zu verbinden. Wenn man sich an die Gebrauchsanweisung h&#228;lt... Wer denkt "Gebrauchsanweisungen sind f&#252;r Verlierer!"... Viel Gl&#252;ck. Das kann dauern.Wenn man sich jedoch sch&#246;n gewissenhaft an die Schritt-f&#252;r-Schritt Anleitung h&#228;lt, kann nichts schief gehen. Okay - man sollte das Passwort f&#252;r sein heimisches Wlan parat haben. Und das f&#252;r sein Spotify Konto, wenn man Spotify auf der Uhr nutzen m&#246;chte. Ich mochte das und das Koppeln war wieder absolut (!) simpel. Ich kann s&#228;mtliche Alexa Ger&#228;te ansteuern, oder mir aussuchen, auf welchem Ger&#228;t Musik h&#246;ren will. Alles problemlos.Weil ich gerade bei Alexa bin... Ich habe mehrere Male versucht, die Beleuchtung in meiner Wohnung (Hue Birnen) und Wlan Steckdosen von unterwegs aus zu schalten. Und es hat jedes (!) Mal funktioniert. Einwandfrei und zuverl&#228;ssig. Auch das Smartlock zu bedienen - mit der Vesta 2 keine Probleme. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass man aus Neugierde und Vorfreude den einen oder anderen Schritt &#252;berspringt oder was nicht richtig einstellt. Und das es dann deswegen Probleme gibt. Die Uhr ist einwandfrei und funktioniert wie eine 1!Thema Armband. Da hat jemand geschrieben, dass ihn das Montieren des Srmbandes in den Wahnsinn getrieben h&#228;tte und man daf&#252;r gute Nerven br&#228;uchte. Na ja, ich hab\' mich auch hier genau an die Anweisung gehalten, das Armband im spitzen Winkel anzusetzen bevor ich den "Riegel" zuschiebe und - es hat funktioniert. Ich denke tats&#228;chlich, dass die meisten "Das funktioniert gar nicht!!!" Kommentare nur daher kommen, dass sich Leute die Gebrauchsanweisung schenken und dann komplett im Wald landen. Nat&#252;rlich ist dann die Uhr daran schuld...Ich bin total begeistert und w&#252;rde die Uhr sofort wieder kaufen! Meinerseits eine Empfehlung f&#252;r jeden, der sich nur eine Uhr kaufen will, aber es gut findet, jeden Tag auf ein anderes Zifferblatt zu sehen. Ob die Uhr lebensnotwendig ist...? Mit Sicherheit nicht. Aber sie macht unglaublich Spa&#223; &#128077;&#127995; Und wer ohnehin ein klein wenig technikbegeistert ist, wird die Uhr lieben!p.s.Wer sich &#252;ber den silbernen Rand des Geh&#228;uses wundern sollte - ich habe mir gleich von Anfang an ein Cover f&#252;r das Geh&#228;use zugelegt. Genau genommen zwei. Eines mit schwarzem und eines mit silbernem Rand._____________________________________________________________________________________Nachtrag am 18. Januar 2020 - von 5 auf 2 Sterne reduziert.Die Uhr war wirklich klasse. Bis gestern. Denn es geht nichts mehr. Zumindest mit der App. Der App, die unbedingt n&#246;tig ist, um die Uhr funktionieren zu lassen. Und dazu der armseligste Support aller Zeiten. Der Reihe nach...Es ging damit los, dass sich die Wlan Einstellungen in der App nicht mehr &#246;ffnen liessen. Ich dachte zuerst an einen Fehler, den man durch Neustart beheben k&#246;nnte. Neustart der App und auch Neustart des Handys. Keine Ver&#228;nderung. Jetzt wird\'s aber erst richtig interessant! Ich bekam &#252;ber die App eine Email, in der mir gesagt wurde, dass der Akku Ladestand niedrig sei und ich die Uhr laden solle. Kein Problem - der Akku h&#228;lt sehr lange. Uhr geladen, alles bestens.Nur liess sich die Uhr ab jetzt nicht mehr mit der App synchronisieren. Ich hatte den FitBit Support angeschrieben. Dort wurde ich auf die Hilfe Seiten verwiesen. Okay. Uhr ausschalten, wieder einschalten. Bluetooth Verbindung trennen und wieder verbinden. App deinstallieren, Uhr ausschalten, App neu installieren, Uhr einschalten u.s.w.  Resultat: Nichts. Nur eine Fehlermeldung, dass die Synchronisierung nicht erfolgen kann. Warum? Das wird leider nicht gesagt. Dann die L&#246;sung aller Probleme: Die Uhr vom FitBit Konto abmelden, die App deinstallieren, App wieder laden, installieren und dann die Uhr wieder anmelden. Klingt nachvollziehbar. Aber jetzt... Die App ge&#246;ffnet, in meinem Benutzerkonto angemeldet - alles in Ordnung. Jetzt die Taste " +Neues Ger&#228;t anmelden" gedr&#252;ckt. Dann kommt eine Auswahl, in der man das Modell anw&#228;hlen soll, das man eben anmelden m&#246;chte. In meinem Fall Versa 2. Dann gelangt man auf ein blaues Feld, in dem unten steht: Einrichten. Da drauf geklickt und - das war\'s. Sackgasse. Nur noch eine Fehlermeldung (siehe Bild). Und damit endet der Versuch, die Uhr in der zugeh&#246;rigen App anzumelden. Keine Synchronisation mehr, keine Wlan Einstellungen, kein gar nichts.Und zum Schlu&#223; die Kirsche auf der Sahne... Der Support von FitBit teilte mir mit, dass das Problem wohl bekannt sei - dass das schon einigen Nutzern so ergangen sei, aber dass man im Moment leider nicht helfen k&#246;nne. Und man hat sich im Voraus sehr freundlich f&#252;r meine Geduld bedankt. Ich habe jetzt also eine Uhr, die perfekt funktioniert hat, bis die App von einen auf den anderen Tag einen Bug produziert der alles (!) stoppt und der Support mir h&#246;flich erkl&#228;rt, dass man da wohl nichts machen kann.Ich habe also &#252;ber 180.- Euro f&#252;r eine Uhr bezahlt, die wegen eines bekannten (!) Softwareproblems einfach nicht mehr benutzbar ist. Die Foren, die sich mit Smartwatches befassen, haben be&#228;ngstigend viele Eintr&#228;ge von Usern, die ebenfalls Probleme mit der Software haben. Wenn die Uhr mit der App funktioniert, ist sie erstklassig. Aber wenn die Software so voller Bugs und Fehlern ist, dass die Uhr pl&#246;tzlich nur noch eine nette Dekoration am Handgelenk wird, ist das nicht gut. Und auch nicht fair gegen&#252;ber den Kunden, denen hier offensichtlich &#252;bereilt etwas angeboten wurde, das noch nicht durchentwickelt war. Die Uhr geht zur&#252;ck, vielen Dank...'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Duex-Portable-Lightweight-Brightness-Adjustable/dp/B07TDDSJ93/ref=lp_16225007011_1_1705/146-3158234-5223736?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594298&amp;sr=1-1705</link><review> \ 'Love it and hate it!! To be honest, the design is flawed. I now understand why they provide SO SO many extra sticky magnets....every time I take the screen off....it takes one or more magnets with it...a couple of other things. It is also very unsteady. Your not going to be walking around with this thing attached to your laptop without holding it tight...as a person who uses a portable monitor on a daily basis  I have to ask myself what more does this provide...the answer is nothing...it&#8217;s unstable, falls off...and the case for this is larger that the top of my laptop (Dell XPS 13). So for the same amount of money you could buy a portable screen (ASUS, Dell, there&#8217;s a bunch) with much much better resolution and sit it next to your laptop..I wanted to to like this....I really did but not worth it. The sticky magnet issue, unstableness, and large mount that is bigger than my screen are deal breakers for me...hopefully the manufacturer reads this - have you thought about making a bracket that slides over the top and to sides of the laptop screen instead of magnets? Great idea I was so excited for this....but maybe the next go around the design will be better..</review><review> 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0BEST PURCHASE ON AMAZON SO FAR!!

Its heavy.  Very Heavy.  There is no balance with the body, and it strains my wrist to hold it.  I purchased the Peak Design Clutch and that made a world of difference on the positive side.  When getting ready for a family site-seeing trip, I found the camera with attached lens would not fit in my 5L camera bag.  the barrel and length of the lens was too big.  I put the camera and lens in a backpack, and off we went.  By the end of the day, my back was sore and my arms tired.  It is that heavy (or rather, it is that unbalanced as it strained my wrist).  I only took a few portait shots of my family, and I noticed that I was usually at F4 or smaller.  To get to 2.8, I had to manually over-ride the program setting.  The photos are amazing, but the camera was so heavy that I dred using it the following day.  I used my iPhone instead.  This is when I learned that there is a reason why Sony offers a 24-70/2.8 GM, and a 24-105/4.  Its all about the trade-off between portability and shallow depth of field.I purchased the 24-105/4 for the purpose of being a site-seeing lens.  It is much lighter, and much shorter, and a smaller diameter ... it travels a lot easier by using a smaller camera bag.  The weight is much more balanced, and easier on my wrist providing a lot more comfort for all-day shooting.  The extra reach from the telephoto is also nice for site-seeing as many items in museums are beyond reach of a 70mm lens, but I still want that 24mm for family group shots.With this learning, here is what I am doing.  The 24-70/2.8 is my portrait lens, and it will be used when i am shooting closer subjects in a darker setting of low duration.  The 24-105/4 is my travel and site seeing lens.  Both have a purpose.But now that I said all of this, consider the following - I also have a 85/1.4 GM that can easily replace the 24-70/2.8 for potraits, and I have the 18-35/2.8 GM lens that can replace the 24-70/2.8 GM for wide angle nature photography.  In some respects, the 24-70/2.8GM lens is no longer needed and can be sold.  If I was starting from scratch, I would not have purchased the 24-70/2.8 GM.One last comment - I do have the 70-200/4 lens, and love it for its lighter weight and better balance than the 70-200/2.8 GM.  I realize that I loose an f-stop, but I doubt I would use a lens that is too hard on my wrist.In summary, the GM lenses are the considered the best lenses.  They come at a higher price, higher weight, and longer length that reduce their portability and usability.  Before thinking that only the best lens will do for you, think about ergonomics and the strength of your wrist.  You might find that the best lens is the one that best serves your personal needs.</review><review> "Very sharp photos throughout the range, a great lens to have on the camera for a variety of situations, be it portrait, landscape, or whatever. Excellent for street photography where a fast lens isn't necessary. This lens has a nice quality feel to it. Paired with the A7iii and image stabilization, it enables some longer than normal shutter speeds while still handheld, as seen in the night time picture attached.", 'So, I swapped my SEL2470Z to this 25105G, mainly for better reach. I expected to have slight loss of absolute image quality, but I was completely proven wrong about that. This lens is as good if not even better than the Zeiss, likely due to the OSS.Now, I use it on my A7Riii body which also has nobody stabilization. Even in low light the shots turn out beautiful.Color rendering as well on this lens is magnificent. If I miss anything, it would be the size of the zeiss... but I do not miss that lens at all as this Sony G lens has completely blown it off the water. Frankly spoken, I am amazed this lens &#8220;only&#8221; costs the 1300 bucks to that matter.</review><review> 'This is quite a step up from the 24-70 f4. It is sharp throughout the entire focal range and focus is fast. The weight of this lens is at the upper limit of what I want to carry all day and much better feeling in hand than the 24-70 f2.8 which feels unpleasantly heavy on a A9. It is easy to understand why this lens has been in short supply for so long.</review><review> "i bought this to eliminate my 28-70 kit, and compliment my 85mm 1.8. Once I put it on and took a photo, this lenses may not come off my camera. Colors are on point, fast focus, and sharp images. Here are a few samples. I would have used my 85mm 1.8 for some of these, but didn't need it. If I wanted a shallow depth I stayed between 85mm-105mm at F4. Feels good in the hand, natural to shoot with. I have attached a few of my samples.", 'It is sharp all around, offers constant aperture, internal stabilization, weather-proofed, dedicated focus-lock button, and a dedicated AF/MF switch. Honestly, very pleased with what it has to offer.Colour reproduction is a bit muted compared to most decent primes, but that can be adjusted in post if you shoot raw. Yes, f/4 is going to scare off some people because of the loss in DoF and 1 stop of light. But this is a zoom-lens. One that can go pretty wide yet reach pretty far. So you need to decide what is more important to you. 1 more stop of light and better bokeh, or better framing capabilities.And yes, people say shoot primes and move around to frame your shots. But we all know that\'s not always possible. As an avid backcountry backpacker, I cannot always get closer to my wildlife subjects. I cannot always go off trail, and I certainly cannot move across bodies of water on foot. So the 24-105mm range gives me so much more flexibility in framing.At the longer end, f/4 at over 75mm still gives pretty decent bokeh. So I also use this guy in some light portrait work, especially with kids, cause I don\'t always have the luxury and time to switch lenses and/or catch up to them. Having the zoom power means I miss fewer moments.For event photographers carrying multiple cameras and mounted primes, this lens probably isn\'t going to do much for you. But for travel photographers that only plan on carrying one lens with them, this is a strong contender in my opinion.Some people say it\'s too "big and bulky". Yes, weight and size is relative and subjective, but I\'m a tiny guy, fairly average fitness, 5\'9/120lbs soaking wet, and I have this mounted on an A7RII while traversing through The Rockies with a 30lb backpack for several days in a row, several times a year. Any average adult should be able to handle it no problem.There is no perfect lens that handles all situations. But this guy comes pretty close for most applications I find.</review><review> "I had tried the Canon 24-105 f4 with a sigma mc11 and found the native lens although being almost a third more expense than that set up results were much sharper, however for a carry around zoom it does feel heavy it's almost as heavy and as big as the 24-70 2.8 GM which is one of the heavier lenses. If that doesn't bother you I am sure you'll love the results you get", 'The used lens was rated as very good and arrived in a nearly perfect condition to me.  Although soon enough I realized the lens hood was missing from yhe delivery, Amazon customer service team attended to my issue and swiftly provided satisfactory resolution.  It was a good experience overall.Product wise, this is a fantastic lens for my videoshooting requirement.  There are many in-depth reviews about this lens on the web.  This is definitely a very nice to have lens to Sony e-mount camera owners.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/XFX-Radeon-1386MHz-Graphics-RX-580P8DFD6/dp/B06Y66K3XD/ref=lp_16225009011_1_1089/141-5273992-2146212?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605590720&amp;sr=1-1089</link><review> \ 'When playing intensive full screen games or benchmarks two of the three display ports have issues with intermittent black screens.

Will likely not consider XFX for my next GPU purchase.", "I'll begin by saying that the RX 580 8GB itself is probably one of the better cards for its modest pricetag of around &#163;180 in early 2019, however, this particular model has a lot of shortcomings which leave me questioning why I didn't return it right away.I was more than satisfied when I first purchased as it was a lovely upgrade to my modest GTX 1050. Game performance wise it was fantastic and my benchmarks improved considerably especially when the card boasts overclocks out of the box. However, I was somewhat naive and blinded about some horrible issues which were occurring which otherwise would have lead me to return the card - unfortunately it's too late now.Running a dual monitor setup, every time the card was under load (basically any game of any level), the second monitor would audibly and visually flick on and off. My initial concerns were a dodgy DisplayPort lead, so I replaced that: no success. Then, as the monitor was new, I assumed it was defective and replaced it too: still no success and the flickering continued. Lastly, I ended up leaving for holiday and on return just accepted that I don't need two monitors to play games on and I can just switch my second off to prevent the flickering. Job done.Anyway, after wanting my second running again, I decided to investigate how to fix the issue. As instructions in the box suggested, I used Global WattMan to UNDERVOLT the graphics card (that's right, the extra I paid for I'm now losing) however that only reduced the problem and did not solve it. The flickering, the 'snapping' sound continues to this day.Honestly, steer clear of this particular card. I'm not sure if it's XFX GTS edition, the RX 580 8GB in general or the particular card I've received, but it isn't a rare occurrence. Numerous posts found on Google and Reddit lead to the same question and issues being raised.I'll be selling this on for a fraction of what I bought it for and purchasing a Vega 64 and hope it's not an ongoing issue with certain Radeon boards.1 star for price, 1 star for general gaming performance.

I&#8217;ve been using sceptre for years, I started with a 24 in curved and then upgraded to a 27 144hz curved and those were amazing, zero problems and recently bought this one. It&#8217;s been a bit of a grieving experience this time. I hope they fix this.Update 5/14On 5/7 customer service informed me this is a defect and my unit needs to be serviced. I was told that within 48 hours I will receive a packing slip to print via email. On 5/12 I emailed them and told them I had not received the packing slip. I still haven&#8217;t heard from sceptre.5/17Still haven&#8217;t heard from sceptre. Maybe it because of covid and cali&#8217;s strict lockdown, but also I feel like this is something that can be easily addressed with working at home. I won&#8217;t be purchasing from sceptre again.

Since so many of these albums were from my younger days, I decided to save the vinyl. These sleeves (I'm on my second package) were inexpensive and durable enough to get the job of storing the cleaned vinyl (used a Spin Clean for that job) done very satisfactorily.These are thin enough to fit back into the covers that I could salvage, along with the original paper sleeve and any inserts.I now plan to clean and place all of my LPs into these sleeves.", 'While trying to save about 150 of my  favorite, rare or unique records, I have used a combination of acid free paper, square vinyl sleeves, and these rounded sleeves.  I currently have some paper ones, and I am sure I risk subtle scratching, paper particles, and aging.  This product, on the other hand, is about the same price and much better for my LP\'s.  And for those I really care about or may want to sell, I\'d recommend the "rice paper" or square paper with vinyl inside.  However, as just a person with records, not a collector, this is the best bang for the buck.  Only a "4" rating for ease of use because placing icurved corners on one side into a square cardboard will sometimes cause it to bunch up inside, and takes more time to make it fit right.  Still, for the dollar, and just someone looking to add life to LP\'s,  this is a good choice.  Happy with the product.</review><review> 'Curved bottom sleeves are less expensive, maybe a scosch harder to use. But the price per sleeve is well worth it. Same exact material and feel &amp; about 1/2 the price of well known full square models. My albums (1000+) are almost all older &amp;in superb shape, so I put these inside the original paper sleeves after a thorough RCM cleaning. Keeps vacuum cleaned LPs clean and static free. On my 3rd hundred, so far. Only wish the bag they came in was resealable.

This *by far* the best and the others were -crap- one brand cost $10 more than this Seneo unit!The significant ADVANTAGES of this Seneo unit over others I and tried and returned:- Seneo does wireless charging right for iPhones. My wife and I used the the older phone-only Seneo charging-stand since the iPhone 8 Plus, and it\'s been reliable for years. It looked very nice and just worked.  Nice modestly lit  discrete light strip on the stand on that unit was blue when no phone and turned green when you set the phone in the stand so you knew it was charging.  This unit is similar but smaller panel light.  After getting exasperated with two other "triple-play" stands (e.g. unit for phone, watch, airpods) (that I had to return), I was thrilled to bumped into this Seneo triple play unit on Amazon. Got it and we love it. Seneo\'s design/engineering team is noticeably more skilled than other brands because they got all the important details and fittings right. Looks, fittings, design, user-friendly/ergonomics and reliability.  That\'s no accident, that company knows what it\'s doing. Note: I\'m NOT affiliated, but I do engineering work and love things that work well, so I notice such details.- It has a small footprint, so it grips and stays poised more even on slightly uneven surfaces. That compactness also saves space. It is a decent looking unit.  Some units I\'ve seen on Amazon may look a little sexier, but the ones I\'ve seen tend to either cost more, or the phone lies flat, or they have a bigger footprint, or they require the latest most expensive *wireless* charging Air Pod case, so not good for older (wired charging) Air Pods.- The phone stand, and the watch/airpod section are magnetically attached to each other with a clever connection apparatus, engineered to works flawlessly. It behaves as a single unit, but allows you to use the phone charger and watch/airpod charger separately if you need to.- The Seneo unit has only ONE cable coming out the back!  That\'s important because it avoids an ugly multi-cable mess and requiring more charging units / receptacles in the wall.- With this unit you use the charger that came with the iPhone, the charger disc that comes with the Apple Watch and, I don\'t recall,  but I believe you need the *cable* that comes with the Air Pods (or similar).  The watch charger disc press-fits into the stand neatly, and the cables are perfectly concealed in the watch/airpod section of the stand by a sliding door on the bottom of the stand, where you plug the cables in, tuck them inside and slide the door back on. And, whalla! ... all cables perfectly hidden and one discreet cable coming neatly out the back.HERE IS WHAT I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT THE OTHER BRANDS (THAT I TRIED AND DISGUSTEDLY RETURNED):A DIFFERENT VENDOR  we tried was so *badly* engineered it require a 3-cable rat\'s nest coming out the back! Who signed-off on that abomination? No one wants to see three cables running-up to a single unit if they can avoid it!And that other unit cost just as much or more than the Seneo!  Also, that other brand had cable guides (grooves on the underside) that you had to route the cables through, but they didn\'t even have any kind of tabs or mechanism to hold the cables in place, plus, the cables were too loose in the guides, so somehow not only were they a hassle to press in, but if you lifted or moved the unit, the cables popped out and then the stand would not sit flat! I mean that kind of amateur junk should not even be on the market! I suspect a lot of similar knock-offs  have that problem, since some are just the same models re-branded or just variations from the same amateur engineering mentality.An another vendor/model we had simply would not wirelessly charge the iPhone 11 Pro Max even through a *thin* silicone iPhone case! To wirelessly charge the phone, we had to have NO case on it, making that other brand *worthless* as a wireless charger!I found other vendor/models trying to sell a lot of units by foisting themselves off as all-things to all phones  (e.g. tried to work with any and every phone manufacturer, size and model), but don\'t succeeed at anything particularly well.  One unit had the charging coil kind of exposed on a movable pad that you had to use a dial to mov up and down try to find the right location for your phone model and brand and size. It not only looked tacky, but is obviously not necessary because Seneo units have a clean simple nice looking, nicely finished flat backrest that  works flawlessly and requires no adjustment.</review><review> 'I love my new charging station!! Works great, easy to set up. No issues with wireless charging, even with my case on - which has been a problem with other wireless chargers I&#8217;ve tried.  Highly recommend!</review><review> 'Ok I jumped out of my seat when I finally found this dock. I just wanted one place to charge all my stuff and I&#8217;ve tried several. THIS ONE IS PERFECT.

There&#8217;s no question on whether it&#8217;s charging or not. Once connected, there is a soft light that will glow when it&#8217;s fully charged. You need to provide your own charger for the watch BUT you can tuck the cord away, so no mess! (which is my favorite feature btw) Why else would you buy a dock if not to hide all those messy cords? Overall, YAAAASSSS QUEEN. I love this dock. I&#8217;d buy it again and again (although Thanks to the quality- I won&#8217;t need to)Here&#8217;s an update! I&#8217;ve had this charging dock for about a month and a half now and I am OBSESSED! I want to buy 100 of them just because I love it so much. I know that sounds ridiculous but this is a seriously great charging dock. PERFECT for the Apple lover in your life. My Apple Watch charges seamlessly, As well as my AirPods. I recently got a new iPhone 11 and a new case for it, it&#8217;s one of those extra cases, that has a glitter waterfall on the back (meaning it adds an extra 1/2&#8221; to the case itself and the charging dock STILL charges my phone wirelessly. So, even through a thick phone case, the wireless charging feature still works like a charm.</review><review> 'Easy setup, Apple Watch base is easy to install and cord fits nicely in compartment. Charges phones nicely without losing connection. I have charged an iPhone X, 11 Pro and a GS9. It just works!  Charger is silent.

The iPad that came had no blemishes or scratches whatsoever and it works just like new. I love it, however one thing that&#8217;s annoying is how long it takes to charge the iPad. It could be at 45% and an hour later barely be at 58%. Maybe because it&#8217;s not the actual Apple charger. (Putting it on airplane mode will help it charge faster). Which reminds me, one other thing I don&#8217;t like is how the charger block gets extremely hot and in a short amount of time. So I can&#8217;t even use it.  The good thing tho is that in my experience so far it has a long battery life. It also can handle multitasking very well. Other that this things, I haven&#8217;t had any problems and everything else has worked great.Also, as an artist, drawing with it has been great!Update: the charger that came actually doesn&#8217;t cut it at all. I&#8217;d been charging it for halfway through the day and the whole night before it even got to 80%.

Personally, i found that 1 to 2 warm to hot showers lasting 15 minutes is a good starting point. I use no soap, and focus on removing all oils from entire body. Next, I have learned that the amount of water on the body truly affects the exfoliation process. When my skin is wet but not dripping wet, after a brief air dry or light towel pat down exfoliation goes smoother. Lastly, but most important in using this product is to use up and down or side to side hand movements. I have found circular movements to be less effective.

Price wise I think they're still a better value than some of their competitors, but I can't help but feel disappointed with the diminished quality.

I followed up with some lightly perfumed body lotion-it&#8217;s probably not a good idea to use any strongly perfumed lotion or your skin may sting.The washcloth is a cheap, easy, and very effective way to achieve lovely smooth skin.Delivery was very quick.

I will try to add a picture later to show how nice and clean it mounts.The issues.  We have a Samsung TV that is not flat across the back; there is a bump at the bottom about three inches long.  The arms have to clear this so I had to use a spacer.  That creates a problem as the thickness of the arms, plus the spacer, plus the mount (which is more narrow than the arms so they sit on top regardless) means that the included M8-30mm bolt is too short.  I had to go to Lowes and buy M8-40mm bolts that only came with a hex head and not a Philips one like the included.  The other small issue is that a wing nut would have been easier to mount the nibs into the keyholes of our Denon soundbar.  I was not confident, and am still weary, about it staying put.I would definitely recommend this to others.

Your only regret will be that you'll never ever want to be without one ever again! Your feet will thank you for it too! ***note for some reason I have found the the flower shaped ones last longer and scrub a tiny bit better, not sure why. ***", 'I don&#8217;t understand how this is categorized as a foot scrub. Maybe a foot wash, but definitely not a scrub. The moisturizing soap side is really slippery, and the sponge side it far too soft. All the sponge does is larger the soap. It does not have any exfoliating pumice qualities to it.</review><review> "I somehow expected this to be more exfoliating. When I came back and looked over the product page again, I realized it is correctly described and I just didn't read it carefully.PROS:If you want something for cleansing and *very mild* exfoliation, this is perfect.It was easy to use -although a little slippery to hold/grip.It's a good valueCONS:Not for serious exfoliating. My feet made this thing cry like a baby and run like the wind.Can make the shower slippery. All I have is a shower but this is best used in a tub or in a sitting position.Should come with a holder. I put mine in an open baggie so that all the soap and softeners don't drain out of it.Just so you are aware, this comes out of the wrapping as a hard and waxy sponge. It's not soft at all. The whole thing is thicker than I thought it would be and only starts to soften in water. And it gets VERY sudsy.", 'Love this product.I use the the bar to scrub my feet a couple times a week at most and absolutely see and feel a more smoothe, moisturised skin.Half is a sponge-like bar of soap, the other is a mildly coarse scrubbing pad.After several months of use the bar is still very sudsy when activated with water. It drys quickly and sits on the shower shelf. No need to worry about mildew.The bar I received is spur shaped with five points and is very easy to hold onto while scrubbing and sudsy.</review><review> 'Love this item.  I used to purchase them at my local Pharmasave but they are no longer available there. Happy to find them available online.  I ordered several to be sure to have them on hand and to give as gifts to good friends.  They last far longer than the suggested number of washes - if you keep them dry between uses.  I often use them at night before bed and find I am much more relaxed and sleep well with a soothing evening foot wash.  A treat for hard working feet!</review><review> 'I am very impressed with this product. A gentle scrub on my feet washes it and gets ride of the dead skin cells. This is a go-to product to reduce a cracked heel. This leaves my foot feeling smooth, fresh, and clean. I scrub in the shower before I go to bed so my feet will have time to heal overnight. Excellent buy. My only concern is the price. It is a bit pricey for $7, I wish they sold this in pack of 3 or more for a better value.</review><review> 'The idea of this is fantastic! I just wish that the buffer side was significantly more firm. As is -it won&#8217;t do anything to buff callouses... it&#8217;s just a different coloured sponge.

No matter how much you try to tighten them they always have some play, even if you could tighten it enough to not move, the range of motion (which I would assume you don't want in a straight arm type of stand) would never even allow the arms to be level.", "My needs for this monitor stand are a little different than most people. Most people will have 2 monitors that are the same size and usually the same brand -- meaning they'll be the same height and weight on both sides.But I wanted something that was flexible, strong and solid allowing me to put a 24 in TV on one side and a 20 inch VGA monitor on the other. This stand works very well. I also wanted to be able to switch out the 20 inch monitor and put my 15 inch laptop in its place or maybe my 7 inch tablet. My monitors weigh 9 pounds for the 24 inch and 11 pounds for the 20 inch.  The laptop is about 5 pounds.  The monitor stand out of the box is perfect. The stand if supporting like sized monitors is very stable. For what I'm doing I screwed it down because I want to be able switch out monitor and laptop without asking for help. I love it because it was easy to put together and meets my rather unusual needs.The pictures of the back plates show the thumb tightening screws working for the monitor but not for the TV -- I had to get creative e and used some nuts to act as spacers -- the thumb screws were too long.The design is well thought out. You have full range of motion, cord management and even a place to put allen wrenches needed for adjusting positions.I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I buy a lot on Amazon and this is the best designed product I've purchased for a long time.", 'For the price it\'s absolutely unbeatable! There were a few minor Quality Control issues like scratches and smudges, but with everything hooked up I can\'t see them so it\'s fine I suppose.

I was worried that it would be a problem with my 2 curved CF390 series monitors, but it absolutely was a perfect match. The articulating arms are solid and fulcrum in all the right places. They secure just right too!I performed a little modification when using the grommet option. I drilled an 11/32 hole in the desk top and discarded the upper large black metal grommet piece they included. I used a fender washer on the top of the desk sandwiched with the large included lower plate. Super clean, super strong.As the previous reviewer stated, don't hesitate, buy it!!!", "This thing gets delivered FAST!! Without prime, this thing was at my door within 24 hours!!Assembly was straightforward. All tools required for assembly are included in the package.The toughest part was the levelling of the monitors. There are small vertical screws right behind the Vesa plates which needs to be turned using the smallest Allen key. Sometimes it feels like they are not doing anything. My displays were around 1 inch off and seemed like levelling was not working. I kept trying various angles &amp; then I don't know how they eventually got levelled!! I just screwed eveything up so whatever I did does not get undone. Make sure you tighten all screws around vesa plates or you will complain that the parts are loose. Even that last bit of screw turn will help.It has parts for both options, table top or mount. The only disadvantages of table top are 1) It takes some table space 2) There are certain angles of the mount at which the stand can fall over due to weight of the monitors.The cable managers are also valuable to  have a tangle free space around the stand.Overall a vey nice stand at a very cheap price point.", "Overall: Would definitely suggest. It meets my expectations 100%, these guys didn't cheap out at all. Will do what you need.Pros:- Each joint can be tightened (or loosened)  - your monitors will NOT sway around  - you can adjust them and they will stay in placeGreat variety of height  - It goes high enough for taller people  - At a fairly comfortable height (eye level for a 175cm person) the monitors can rotate without hitting the desk.- All important areas are metal- Nice rubber feet (doesn't slide around)- I was worried that it might tilt, seems to balance well. I did not need to drill a hole in my desk, the plate worked fine- Well priced for the quality of material.- I was able to place it such that it isn't exactly at the center, instead I have it to the side, my main monitor is parallel with me, and the secondary is on a 45 degree angle. I was worried that the arms wouldn't reach. But it does!Cons:- The arms cannot have a really low angle, at a point the metal hits it self.  - This isn't a big deal because it goes low enough of an angle, but I'd like a little more maybe.- The height adjustment is more of a one time deal, sure you can update it, but not on the fly like some other mounts.", 'I have two 24" LG monitors that are not particular heavy nor light, and I have no issues with the stand holding them up. The balance of the screens however had me worried originally, but I can swing one screen away and the stand does not wobble or lilt at all. The only time it came close to falling was when I placed both monitors to one side and of course it stated to teeter. So so long as you aren\'t twisting your screens around like a marypole it is plenty sturdy enough.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Chic-Home-Medalion-Embroidery-Comforter/dp/B073FYYQ69/ref=sr_1_62?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Home+bedding&amp;qid=1605596366&amp;s=kitchen-intl-ship&amp;sr=1-62</link><review> \ 'The item very beautiful and sleeps well but it was damaged with a black line on the comforter.

I believe this is a design defect, as I had purchased the same case for an iPhone 7, and for that case there was a 'click' when the door was slid to the fully closed position, resulting in the door staying firmly in place. I returned this case as I feared the door opening unexpectedly resulting in lost credit cards. I'm now using the Spigen Tough Armor for my iPhone 11 and although it doesn't hold credit cards, it seems to work very well. So, I don't think the problem is Spigen cases in general, just a design defect in the Slim Armor CS case for iPhone 11.", "This has been my favorite phone case when I discovered it few years ago. As you can see from the photo, on the right side, there is my old case that I had for past 2 years for my iPhone 7. I've recently upgraded to iPhone 11 and I am so glad this company makes cases for that size. I carry my ID and credit card with me instead of dragging my huge wallet everywhere. I just love how convenient it is. I have attached the magnet on the back side that slides, so I can attached it to my car magnet holder to use for map app when I'm driving. Even with the magnet, there is no problem to fit 2 cards inside. And as you see from my old case, it holds pretty well overtime. Yes, there are some scratches but after 2 years it looks pretty well LOL", 'The entire reason I purchased this product again was because it worked so well for my previous phone (iPhone 8 plus). Unfortunately, now that I&#8217;ve upgraded to an iPhone 11, the quality of the cases from Spigen has decreased. The slider on the back of the case doesn&#8217;t stay closed. With my previous case, it would latch with a clicking noise. The new one just slides closed very quietly as if there isn&#8217;t a latching mechanism. Very disappointed with this. I&#8217;m hoping I just got a faulty product. I can&#8217;t return it though because I already placed my popsocket on the back. Hopefully I can&#8217;t remove it and put it on a replacement, but who knows. Either way, I&#8217;m potentially out money.</review><review> 'Not happy with this design at all, I travel over 130,000 miles a year so when I go through airports I don&#8217;t have time to fiddle with this, it&#8217;s hard to retrieve the cards from the pocket and within days, the flimsy sliding cover allowed the cards to push out the bottom.I had a VENA wallet case for my iPhone 8plus for more than two years and It worked really well.After I return the Spigen I&#8217;ll be ordering VENA&#8217;S VSKIN SLIM WALLET CASE  that supposedly allows the phone to be charged wirelessly.Vena iPhone 11 Card Case, vSkin Slim Wallet Case with Credit Card Holder Slot Kickstand, Designed for iPhone 11 (6.1 inches) - Black https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VXRSZ7K/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_9KU5DbTK76XACI&#8217;ll be writing a review about as well after I&#8217;ve had to carry it for a while</review><review> "Recently upgraded my phone from a 7 to the 11, and I've had this case for my iphone 7 twice (first case chipped slightly when I dropped it, but iphone was unharmed).  I had hoped to find a somewhat sleeker case (preferably clear to showcase my iphone 11,) but had to weigh that against my requirement of having a case that not only protected my phone but my cards as well. This meant anything that showed my cards was out of the question (ie popsocket wallets etc..) Surprisingly there were very few options with the built in, easily accessible card storage option that Spigen provided (I also looked at ratings of other similar models) that were also affordable. So I've bought this case for the third time, and will probably continue to buy it for future phones. There were some complaints about loose 'doors' for the card slots, but mine was totally fine by the way. My only complaint is the matt black does tend to attract smudging more than the colored cases.  And I would love it if Spigen made a clear or semi clear option!", "Overall, it isn't a bad case, but I'm not terribly impressed by it either. I had the same case for my Samsung Galaxy S8 for 3+ years and absolutely loved it - it held up to everything and the card holder was so handy. However, with the iPhone 11 the case feels bulky and feels like it could fall out of my hand at any time. The card holder also seems a bit flimsier than the old case. Overall, I can't give it too low of a score because it is exactly what I asked for, I just don't think it's a great case option for this particular phone."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/ProCase-iPad-Air-10-9-2020/dp/B08GY7NPYN/ref=lp_16225009011_1_5717_cpbg/143-8179022-2104114?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592314&amp;sr=1-5717</link><review> \ 'Fits very tightly, there is no way the iPad would fall out of this case on its own.

I used it for 3 rounds of golf and it stopped working, would not turn on at all. I returned it to Amazon hassle free and they sent me a new watch, I was thinking great customer service. My new watch showed up in 5 days and i checked to make sure it worked, I charged the watch and turned it on, everything was ok. 3 weeks later, it has been raining so I haven't had a chance to golf, I went to go golf and turned the watch on, lasted 3 holes and turned off, it is completely dead and several tries will not turn on. This is the first use out of the box, Amazon is now out of the loop and referred me to the manufacture. Their 30 day policy must start before the product is shipped not when you receive it. What a waste of 400.00.", "I love this watch.  I read the independent reviews online before purchasing, so I knew the incredible amount of features it has.  After reading the negative product reviews on Amazon, I was a little concerned about my ability to learn the settings.  However, after some quick Google searches and watching some videos on YouTube, harnessing the S60's capabilities really wasn't that hard.  You just have to have some patience to learn - this watch can do a LOT of stuff.  After a week of use so far:Pros:*  the golf functions are flawless.  I spent a round on the course messing around with it.  Yardage readings were extremely accurate and it was perfectly visible in direct sunlight.  It was also cool (or embarrassing) to see the yardage of each shot automatically, without having to touch any buttons.*  the watch is versatile.  It's a lot lighter than I expected, for a device with so many options.  It feels the same as my FitBit Blaze, as far as size and weight.  There are also over a hundred watch faces to choose from, so you can easily change the appearance on a whim.  Install the Garmin Face-It app, and you can create your own custom face (included a pic of one I created).*  having used FitBit products for the last ~4yrs, I honestly thing the Garmin is a more-accurate step tracker.  I noticed my FitBit would register 5-8 'phantom' steps during my 45min commute in the car.  I don't know if that's due to vibration in the steering wheel, 'lively hand motions' to other motorists, or whatever.  I notice that the Garmin doesn't give me any 'bonus' steps.  When wearing them at the same time and actually counting steps, the Garmin was more accurate by a couple of steps.*  fantastic battery life.  I've worn it eight straight days, including a round of golf, and still haven't needed to recharge.  Based on my usage, it uses less than 10% a day (I've just used it as a watch today, and it's only used 3% in the 14hrs I've been awake).  Utilizing the GPS and golf features during a round of golf will burn ~25-35%  -  I was messing with it constantly during my round, and it used ~30%.Cons:*  it ain't cheap*  even though it's pricey, it doesn't include a heart monitor - the only thing I miss from my FitBit.  You can add an accessory for that function...for an additional price.*  it's app-happy.  I had to install three apps to cover the features I wanted to utilize;  Garmin Connect (most of the general settings/features), Garmin Golf (granular golf tracking/stats) and Garmin Face-It (custom watch faces).In the end, I have no regrets over the purchase.  I love it.", 'Ich habe mit der Uhr jetzt 2 Wochen verbracht und sowohl 2 Runden gespielt als auch ein paar Tage als Alltagsuhr getragen.Im Prinzip gef&#228;llt mir die Uhr beim Golf spielen ganz gut:- die Uhr funktioniert vollkommen unabh&#228;ngig vom Telefon (bei der Apple Watch ist das ja leider nicht so und ich habe bspw. bei der App Hole 19 dauernd Problem gehabt mit Eingaben von der Uhr, die verloren gingen).- die Eingabe der Schl&#228;ge auf der Uhr funktioniert gut und schnell.- die Anzeige der Distanzen (inkl. H&#246;hendifferenz und "gef&#252;hlter" Spiell&#228;nge) ist prima.- die Fahne zu verschieben auf dem Gr&#252;n ist auch gut.Nachteile sind meiner Meinung nach:- Laden der Bahn beim reinzoomen dauert zu lange (jedesmal wieder, nicht nur beim 1. Mal)- den Laser ersetzt die Uhr leider nicht. Meistens kommt das ganz gut hin mit der Distanz, wenn man die Fahne richtig platziert hat. Des &#246;fteren ist aber zumindest unser Platz nicht ganz Pr&#228;zise kartographiert und es gibt recht gro&#223;e Differenzen (das f&#228;llt auch bspw. in der Platz&#252;bersicht auf, da man tlw. knapp neben dem Fairway liegt, aber laut App mitten in den B&#228;umen).- die Autoshot Funktion und damit die Schl&#228;ger-Distanz Statistik ist leider nicht zu gebrauchen: Bei meiner zweiten Runde Stand bei einem Schlag schon 40 m bevor ich &#252;berhaupt am Ball angekommen war f&#252;r die Uhr die Distanz "fest". Garmin sagt, die Uhr erkennt keine Chips und Putts. Das bedeutet aber auch, dass jeder Schlag ins Gr&#252;n NICHT gemessen werden kann. Angezeigt werden aber dennoch Distanzen und ich versuche noch herauszufinden, woran die Uhr diese festmacht. Wenn man sich die Bahnen in der Garmin Golf App anschaut sieht man leider, dass die Schlagverl&#228;ufe manchmal ganz gut passen, manchmal aber auch einfach komplett daneben sind (bspw. Distanz f&#252;r 4er Eisen entspricht der Summe von Eisenschlag, Chip und Putt).- Bluetooth Verbindung zum Handy/ GarminConnect ist nicht stabil (d.h. SMS Benachrichtigungen kommen dann bspw. auch nicht mehr an)Zusammengefasst behalte ich die Uhr nur, weil sie als Komplett-Paket f&#252;r mich gut ist.

I got the 15.6" non-touchscreen IPS 1920x1080 screen that has a tablet-like case. The color is listed as Black. Other reviews on this page have the color listed as Gray and seem to be for a smaller-sized touchscreen with some kind of metal folding stand. As of this writing, that screen is not listed as an option on this product page. Okay, now on to my review....This is a great screen! It\'s large yet thin and lightweight with thin bezels, a fantastic viewing angle, and side-positioned ports and buttons so it to be mounted flush to the wall. For the size I was expecting it to be heavier but it\'s only like two pounds. My expectation likely came from having a 15.6" laptop which weighed over five pounds. The viewing angle is fantastic as even when looking at it from extreme angles it is very clear and the colors don\'t shift.I recently got a smaller touchscreen monitor for my Network Video Recorder (NVR) only to find out that my NVR doesn\'t support touchscreens, so I decided to use that screen with my mini PC media server and get this larger non-touch screen for my NVR. It comes with a typical tablet case that folds into a stand which should be fine for most people but I\'m going to buy a small VESA mount so I can get it off the shelf and attach it to the wall. The buttons and ports are all located on the side of the screen so this can be easily mounted flush to the wall while still having access to all the ports and controls. It can also use a single USB-C cable for both power and video if your source device supports it. My NVR doesn\'t have a USB-C port so I have to use both a power cable and an HDMI cable, which are both included in the box by the way. My PC has a USB-C port so I tried with that but unfortunately I learned that my PC\'s port doesn\'t support video so it only worked to power the screen.I like that it supports a full HDMI port so I don\'t have to mess with HDMI to mini-HDMI cables since I have a ton of regular HDMI cables and none of the other kind. Or I should say one of the other kind because it comes with one, along with a regular HDMI cable, a USB-to-USB-C cable, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and even a screen protector. I didn\'t notice any Apple type connectors so if you want to use this with an Apple device that doesn\'t have HDMI you\'ll have to provide your own. The screen has built-in speakers which is great for using with my NVR because some my security cameras record audio.This is a very nice screen if you don\'t need a touch screen, with a great viewing angle, built-in speakers, and many connection options. At the time I bought it there was a $20 off coupon which made it even more attractive (and is still available as of this writing).I hope you found my review helpful, please let me know in the comments if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement.

On one side of the bag there were 2 cuts about 8&#8221; long (one of which scratched the paper insert that had the picture of the quilt) and another one about the same size on the other side.  I did finally notice the cuts after folding it up to put it back in it&#8217;s clear zipper bag. The cuts looked like box cutter cuts. I was so afraid the quilt was cut too! I pulled it out and took about 20-30 minutes going over that quilt inch by inch front and back. I ran my finger in a clockwise/counter clockwise circular motion to catch any cuts that I might not be able to see. My fingertips were numb by the time I was done. I never found any cuts...thank goodness! I have so say I wasn&#8217;t happy having to do this! Even if I had noticed the cuts on the bag prior to pulling the quilt out at the start I still would want to check it out in case it was a return from someone else. Also it was packaged with the solid peach backing folded to the outside as opposed to the design showing on the outside which led me to think it might have been a return.

Lighting was great, and the ram worked as well as I expected.Particularly the RGB software (optional) - they have a "jazz" mode, and it will let you set a color AND it will then respond to system sound on your computer. It works REALLY well, some of the best sound-sense software I\'ve seen with lighting, and helps make the ram pop in a way that is really interesting. Especially since the ram is more undertoned when something isn\'t going on, but when music/gaming happens it pops in to life.

In my opinion they all work the same. Its a good cheap beginning tablet that would be great for teens who have a passion for graphic art. The only thing i don't like are the changes to the wacom website. When i owned my bamboo pen i was able to get support and updates on it well into the first intuos' life span. When i finally got my first intuos about 3 years ago, it was fine until a few months ago. I went to the website to download patches or updates as i would have done with the bamboo. However none of them worked. I had to buy a new tablet. I was originally trying to break away from wacom, as they pissed me off with the support aspect, but my budget would not allow me to upgrade at the moment. So i ordered this little tablet. Its decent, nothing has changed on it since the bamboo pen, ita smaller and the cord is longer then the original intuos which is nice. Would not buy if you are a professional, but if your a hobbyist like me or just beginning and want to learn how to draw with a tablet then this is a decent piece of equipment for you. Just beware of wacom trying to phase out old tablets software when they come out with the next generation.", 'I\'ve been using WACOM pen-and-tablet products since 1998. I\'ve had several. They last, on average, about 4 years each. The last one I had was a Bamboo model and the pen finally crapped out a while ago, and buying just the pen is almost as expensive as buying the entire unit so I just tossed it and bought this Intuos model, the lowest priced Wacom product I could find at roughly $90.I don\'t know if I just got a bad unit this time or if the software was simply incompatible with Windows 7 Ultimate (my current OS). I Called Wacom customer service (which was poor, long waiting time, one fellow was hard to understand, the second one sounded drunk) to no avail after several driver installation and re-installation attempts. I ended up returning the unit to Amazon.I ended up buying instead the competition "XP-PEN Star G640" which cost half the price (I paid $43 here on Amazon) and it worked straight out of the box. I\'m using that one right now and functionality is identical to the WACOM tablets I\'ve been used to for 20 years. The only flaw with the XP-PEN is that the pen button is difficult to feel from front to back so I simply carved notches into one end and that solved the problem. Therefore I recommend the XP-PEN over the WACOM in this case.The reason I\'m giving this a relatively high rating is because I must assume it will work for most people even though it didn\'t work for me, and WACOM products have otherwise generally been satisfactory, save for their longevity, which is often because of driver/hardware obsolescence over time and operating system upgrades etc. (deliberate, built-in obsolescence as with all computer products). One star removed because of price compared to the XP pen which is almost identical in functionality save for that button feel, although it remains to be seen if this XP-Pen model will last as long as the WACOM brands or not. The quality of construction seems to be about the same.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Polident-Smokers-Antibacterial-Cleanser-Effervescent/dp/B00CS3CHKS/ref=lp_16225006011_1_2096_m/140-0284325-1416466?s=beauty-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605595278&amp;sr=1-2096</link><review> \ 'I use these to clean the inside of my coffee pots and white ceramic coffee mugs.

The charging case is great and easy to tell if they are fully charged or not.The earbuds themselves are comfortable! They come with 3 earpads, so make sure you are using the correct size for your ears!Extremely easy to set up.

I didn\'t think it was so funny when it went down the toilet but at least I can laugh now!Things I like about these:You can wear as a pair. Left earbud alone or right earbud alone.These fit in my ears unlike the white fruit named brand that does not fit at all.Price is spectacularI bought these to replace a previous pair I owned.  When I first connected the voice sounded muffled and I was afraid.  Once connected I had clear sound.  Phone calls were easy and clear and no asked if I was on speaker or headphonesI LOVE that I can see the amount the case is charged.  I have used them for a few weeks and I&#8217;ve yet to have them die on me.  I don&#8217;t wear them all day but a few hours of podcasts and didn&#8217;t need to recharge.I will often wear one and listen to a podcast while cooking, cleaning etc.  if someone tries to talk to me I have to take it out to hear.  Even if I pause the sound.  It&#8217;s in the ear and I can&#8217;t hear!NOTE. Charging cord is not a micro or lightning connection.  So if you want a longer cord you might not have extras lying around. (See pic)The only issue I might have is the connection.  Like if I leave my phone on the top floor and go in the basement they lose connection BUT my basement is concrete and underground so I&#8217;ll give some slack on that.Overall for the price I paid for these they are a dream.

It is very user-friendly and easy to keep in your ears. Not all kinds of earbuds can fit in my ear but these are great and stick on my ear. The charging box is great and small to carry in the pocket.

The scent is very strong at first --like holding a full box of dryer sheets in your hand--and mellows a bit after the bag's been opened, but it does have very good staying power even once the bag is full.

It really works quite well and I do see some small difference in the picture. This is about our fourth Roku device. My only gripe about this item is the cords (HDMI and power cords are both too short. Instruction says to use the cords sent with the item. Since my HDMI input is on one side of the television and my power source (yes we have power strips) is on the other side my only option was to mount the ROKU itself in the middle of the tv on the bottom. We do have a sound bar in front of the tv, but it does not seem to interfere with the use of the remote. I would advise mounting this ROKU on something as it is very small and very light, It is about the width of two of my long slender fingers and no longer. I don\'t particularly like the remote as much as my old one. it is lighter and less buttons (ok button is in the middle of the cross arrows). No, the old one is not compatible with the new ROKU device. I did however put the ribbon from the old one on the new so as to make it easier to keep track of it. No problems loading my channels in after I got done mumbling about cheap short cords and got everything in place. i am a 74 year old woman so if I can do it, so can you. Total time for installation about 30 minutes.</review><review> "bought this because I wanted to upgrade to a 4k device. I have two other rokus and have been happy with them. The premiere 4k is garbage though. 4k without 802.11ac. It worked ok for the first 24 hours and then was constantly dropping wifi while everything else in the house was fine. They've used cheap chipsets and then overclocked the hell out of them so this little thing idles at almost 90C. The form factor prevents any form of cooling. The remote is the cheap one so you won't be able to control your tv with it. All in all, was glad that I bought on amazon at least where the return process is relatively painless", "I got this to replace the Xfinity box in a spare bedroom to avoid the $10 monthly rental fee.  The only problem is almost all of the channels only come in partially. Only Bravo, Comedy Central, ABC &amp; TV Land come in full screen.

Orbi, eero, Velop and Google Wifi are called mesh because you can install multiple access points that all communicate and can self-organize.There are three very important things that you need to remember about mesh,. First the Access Point can be Dual band (2 radio) or Tri-Band (3 radio), Second, a radio can be 4x4 or 2x2 (more rarely 3x3). Thirdly the radio can be high power or medium power.  There is a huge difference in price when you select different options. For example, the Orbi RBK50 series are 4x4 and tri-band and they are very expensive. I bought the RBK23 that is tri-band 2x2 similar spec. as the latest eero. If your budget is infinite, buy an RBK50 series and add more satellite.Don't pay attention to the square footage listed on the product. It is totally misleading because coverage depends on the layout of the house. If you live in a 6,000 sq ft loft with open space, you probably only need one Access Point. If you live in an older house with many halls and the signal bounces around a lot, you need multiple AP and a high power radio for the backhaul. There are no secret formulas for number of access points and house sq footage.Now onto installation. It is very important that you do a survey of your house and determine where to place these Access Points. Don't place them randomly because you will end up with the purple ring of death that many reviewers have complained about. Place them strategically and ideally the satellite should be one hop away from the main router. I know that it is not always possible to do this. You may have to try different locations. This is the hardest part of the installation. The installation procedure offered by Linksys is OK and not fool proof. So, if it fails, restart the installation process.I was shocked that I had to place the Access Point relatively close to each other in order to get a good coverage in my space. I suspect that the RBK23 don't have high power radios. But I placed them strategically in such a way to get a triangle on the App. (v.s., a line) and I now have full coverage in the house. I was also surprised that it takes a long time for the Access Points to converge. I don't know what type of algorithm is used but it takes a long time to settle. I had to wait 3-5 minutes for things to settle down.Lastly if you use Apple Print, and you have another Gateway (e,g., Verizon FiOS or Comcast) then you should make the Orbi an AP not a router. Printing will not work properly if routed due to broadcast traffic.Overall, I am happy with thus purchase, I paid $200 for a kit of 3 Access Point (RBK23) and they do the job for a 3,000 sq foot space.  Thank you for reading.", "I had high hopes for the Orbi after all the reviews I read both here and at other sites but it didn't work out. The first problem came almost immediately when satellite #1 wouldn't pair. I gave up after 4 tries and went to the second satellite and it paired immediately.. So I went back to satellite #1 and it finally paired after 3 tries. Mind you that the satellites were sitting within 2 feet of the Orbi router.Next I ran the firmware update that it requested I do. That went flawlessly and only took 3-4 minutes.I then moved the satellites to their distant positions and they paired up very quickly over wifi. The speed test within the Orbi app showed me 119mbps download anywhere I went in my house!I have cat6 ethernet run to the satellites positions so I connected the satellites and my problems began. I immediately lost connection to both satellites. By powering them down/up and reconnecting the ethernet cables several times I finally got both of them to show up again. The problem here was the Orbi app - each time you do anything it may take 5+ minutes for the change to be registered by the app. So all of this fiddling around took almost 3 hours! Plus, I could never get the app to show a wired connection, only wifi. Even moving a satellite back near the router and connecting them with a 2 foot patch cable wouldn't show a wired connection.That 119mbps throughput shown by the Orbi app was problematic, too. I could stay right where the app showed me that great connection and the Speedtest app and fast.com would both show only 20-25mbps. Quite a difference! The best I could get from either satellite was 35mbps. I was getting over 110mbps with my old AC-capable routers in bridge mode and was not happy with only 25mbps.Bottom line: 1) The Orbi app is terrible. Plan on having several hours for what should be a simple installation. 2) speed testing with the Orbi app is not believable 3) I could never get a wired connection between the router and either satellite even after updating the firmware 4) throughput from the satellites was poor.I was using an existing, proven-good network so that was not the problem. I took my first computer programming course in 1969 and used to own a networking company so I don't feel I was the problem.Needless to say, the Orbi RBK23 is on its way back to Amazon.", 'Ten&#237;a un router de Linksys con 3 antenas, muy robusto y funcional.

The Vabogu somewhat matches the AKG on sounding as though I am inside your head..  very near to you, like in the same room. But the Vabogu sounds a bit as though denim cloth is over my mouth. I now realize it's probably because there is no actual mic hole in the in-line mic controller. If I use a tiny drillbit to possibly drill a hole, then maybe I'll achieve that clear sound. But for now, the mic does a very good job capturing my voice as though I'm inside the room with you.... very powerful. I'd like to see a mic-hole in the next iteration of these earbuds.

Lays flat (see photo), which actually relieves stress on your wrists (but you can still flip out the tabs on the bottom if you want it tilted up).2.  "F" and "J" keys have well-defined tactile markers so you can quickly put your fingers in the right position without looking (for those who learned to type "properly").3.  Function keys at the top are grouped in fours to more easily find them without looking.4.  Feel of keys is a nice balance of firmness and quietness.5.  Mouse click is nice and quiet.Cons:1.  I\'m ambivalent on the mouse--a little shallower than a typical mouse, but not hard to get used to.2.  No other cons at the moment.  Not sure about battery life yet--if it\'s a problem, I\'ll update this review.</review><review> 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0This is a standard 104 key keyboard with a standard mouse that connects to any device using a 2.4 GHz Wifi dongle. Very easy to set up and use. You do need 3 AAA batteries, one for the keyboard and two for the mouse that is not included. Everything looks great in all black and the keys on the keyboard and the buttons on the mouse both work smoothly, without much noise and are easy to push. No sticking or clicking here. They do both have an on/off button so you can turn them off to save the batteries if not being used for a while and if not, the mouse will turn off after 10 minutes of not being used. I also love that there are LED lights for the num lock and Cap lock as well as one for the battery life on the keyboard. Not all come with that and to me, makes a big difference.</review><review> 'I was undecided between this, and another option from a more recognized brand for another $15 or so - and am glad i saved the money, ending up with a good product.From a design standpoint, it\'s simple, utilitarian, and not flashy. Light but noth featherweight, and has essential keys, number pad, and illuminated caps lock, num lock, and low battery night. Perfectly functional, with a matte type finish, square - standard sized buttons.. This was all in line with what I prefer.Button striking has a palpable click - as opposed to a "feather" touch. I type...hard...for some reason, as if i was angry at every email I\'ve ever sent, so this was a welcome feature. The mouse is a slimmer profile, which I usually don\'t like, but it has enough dimension and volume to feel comfortable and not fragile in the hand. Cool sensitivity button let me turn it all the way up, as I like to use my mouse in a small space.I currently have this driving my work PC - which is screencasting directly to the 60" flatscreen on my living room wall. No lag, no missing characters when I type, etc.  Also really like that there is a single USB transmitter for both the mouse and keyboard, to save outputs for other things.For the money - this is a great value, couldn\'t be happier.</review><review> "I was looking for a good long-range keyboard and I finally found it!  It wasn't easy sifting through the numerous keyboards on amazon.com.  Believing obviously fake reviews, well this one isn't!  Amazon is great though, I purchased and returned three or four keyboards and saw this one with good reviews which made me leary, lol.  Turns out, it's fantastic for long-range.

I love the reasonable price and the fantastic quality and functionality of this LONG RANGE Keyboard!  This isn't a brand I have ever heard of but it's nice to find a high quality brand such as this!", "Let's get straight to the point, I went in wanting a keyboard for writing. I spent a lot of time drafting and rewriting and wanted a keyboard that would lay flat and wouldn't make a lot of noise when I type. If that is also something you're looking for this keyboard is great.The keyboard lies flat to the table but also has foldable legs that could also give it an incline. The keyboard is quiet, it does have a bit of the click noises but nothing like mechanical keyboards. The mouse, however, COMPLETELY SILENT, this was my favorite part. You'll never hear this mouse click EVER-- and the scroll wheel is smooth. And like everyone, the range on this keyboard is awesome the 35ft rings true and makes it easy to move around. If I ever need a nice keyboard for a good price I would definitely buy this again."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-VX2452MH-Gaming-Monitor-inputs/dp/B00EZSUVHK/ref=lp_16225009011_1_1181_det/147-4784189-5501829?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605590753&amp;sr=1-1181#productPromotions</link><review> \ 'I needed a replacement for my high-end 4:3 Philips monitor.

My assessment has not changed after ten days of use.

No surprise there,  however the speaker volume with the PC and monitor controls fully high is a medium level at best and certainly never loud.

I have naturally white/gray hair and this just gives it that extra something. It takes my color from dull salt &amp; pepper to shiny silver. I originally bought this for my 17-year-old daughter who had dyed her hair silver. It kept her color from fading and looking dull. After she decided to switch to pink I started using the product so it wouldn't go to waste and I've now reordered 3 times. I will mention that although this is a cleansing conditioner I still use shampoo (silver lights) and then use this product as if it was normal conditioner - I comb it through my hair and leave it for however long it takes me to shower. Most of the negative reviews I've read are people using this in place of hair dye. This is not a hair dye, it is meant to replace your current shampoo/conditioner to maintain color. It works beautifully when used as it was intended.", "This is product is amazing!!!I've tried different aha poos for red colored hair and they just don't do anything for my hair ir they leave my hair feeling like it has residue.

I cannot believe it!!! I'm so happy with this product that I'm ordering more as we speak!!!", 'Ok so I ordered this in Rose Gold &amp; Pink.To start off my hair was lightnened to a white. I used the light Pink first. The color was vibrant! It was a light bright pink after the first wash, and got darker after every wash.After I got bored with that I moved on to the Rose Gold. This is why I gave a 4 vs 5 review- while the color on the bottle showed a dark color, it was a purple on my hair, not Rose Gold. I like the color, but the name throws me off. Even after washing my hair to get the color out it is more of a lilac vs a Rose Gold.Here are some tips: apply to DRY HAIR &amp; let it sit, then rinse. I would work the clenditioner for about 3-4 minutes on dry hair and just chill with it in for about 10-15. This created vibrant color that stayed in my hair for a while even with regular washing with a shampoo that has sulfates. Why would I wash with sulfates? To fade the color as a experiment.This product is great, I would absolutely buy it again.The color in the photo is Rose Gold, 3 washes with the Klenditioner, 2 washes with a sulfate shampoo. More pink-ish today, but purple when applied at first. Could also be because my hair was white when I started.</review><review> 'This stuff blows my mind. It deposits a considerable amount of color and really refreshes my long copper hair. I have found it works best if I put it on dry hair and let it rest for 20 minutes or more. The color is buildable which is a nice feature and if it gets too much for me I can just use regular condition for a wash and it fades the color a bit. This isn&#8217;t a long term color you can use with your harsh shampoos and expect to last. Just know what you are purcasing and you won&#8217;t be disappointed. I have left off one star because I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s particularly great as a moisturizer or conditioner. It&#8217;s a great color depositing gentle shampoo alternative.

Rather than spreading the mask over your skin like a moisturizer, you unfold this mask and spread the pre-dampened towelette over your entire face.  So far, I have only tried one of the masks in this set, the avocado.  I was surprised to find that there is a lot of liquid in the packet; it is practically dripping wet.  The mask was easy enough to spread over my face and fit fairly well (see photo).  I left on about 15 minutes as recommended.  The mask does not dry out during this time, so you peel it off when it is still wet.  My skin did feel nice after, soft and supple.

I want an antibacterial soap, but one that has a clean fresh smell. This one easily fits the bill. The issue with most soaps is that they do a great job at getting you clean and smelling fresh, but at the expense of badly drying out your skin. Dry skin is not good for you, so therefore soap that dries out your skin just to get you clean is completely counterproductive. Sure, you can lotion up or use another type of skin moisturizer, but who wants to worry about that additional step every time they bathe or wash their hands? Not me!  I can say that this soap does not dry me out at all. It leaves my skin feeling soft with no indication of being dried out at all.  I highly recommend giving this a try, you won't be disappointed.

This product is awesome. Please realize that you have no option to use batteries with this mod pack, it is completely wired with the provided micro usb cord. There is a lot to read in the manual but I highly suggest you read the entire thing to get your money\'s worth. Great product, comfortable paddles, SUPER simple button mapping, as well as premade modes for specific games (nothing for fortnite). Very happy with the purchase. Ignore the other reviews saying "problems with headset" or buzzing sounds. Make sure your controller is upgraded properly and use THE PROVIDED USB. I have zero issues with my headset and my friends have never heard any buzzing. In regards to the other bad review about an opened and used box.... mine came brand new, no issues, in a sealed box. If you have this issue, contact the company before sending a long hurtful review about a product that still probably wound up working perfectly used. Thank you guys for the amazing product.</review><review> "I wanted to buy and elite controller, didn't want to spend the $150, so I went with this instead. Very happy I did! Paddles are great and super easy to map out. The paddles themselves are not the most comfortable in the world, so I put some grip on them and that helps a ton. Have not had any issues with paddles or the power cord. Very happy customer!", 'The product is a good idea, the materials used to build it not so much. I bought this on July 16th (3 months and 10 days ago) and one of the paddles already broke. I&#8217;m an adult, casual player, without children, who uses the this product for an average of seven hours a week, therefore the fact that it has failed after so little use is telling of the quality of the materials.Beware serious, younger players</review><review> 'I bought these for my son instead of buying an Elite of Scuff controller. The installation was easy and only took a few minutes. at first he thought it would be difficult to have a wired controller but it makes for a more responsive gaming experience. The paddles are a great way to improve your game while not breaking the bank. My son has recommended them to friends. Overall great product. Very happy with the purchase. The included Micro USB cord is more than long enough.</review><review> 'The product itself works great, is easy to map, and is good quality, but the power chord makes a buzzing sound while using a microphone.

All this information is available on Avantree website.I would advise you to buy separate Addition Pro Headphones and for the Bluetooth TX/RX It&#8217;s a bit more tricky depending on your circumstances but the standard Oasis &amp; Audikast are good but be warned this might end up costing you a bit more. Only buy the Oasis Plus TX/RX if you need the Range and you have a Compatible AptX HD headphones (side note the new Bluetooth codec is out called AptX Adaptive) Also you might not even need a Bluetooth TX/RX if you have a Compatible Smart TV just buy the headphones and connect through Bluetooth.Avantree I would advise you to put a set together that includes the Addition Pro Headphones &amp; a Bluetooth TX/RX.</review><review> "I bought those as a replacement for my HT4189 (previous model) that worked really well. There are a few improvements, but nothing that I needed.Build is good as before, the sound is good, virtually no lag and when listening to music, impressive sound quality. Although I am used to the system, I couldn't to get it to work initially. I connect the optical output of my TV to the avantree emitter and is is simple enough, but I didn't hear anything through the headphone. I contacted Avantree support through chat, and the second question I was asked was whether I had connected the optical input to the right connector in the Avantree emitter, and I hadn't.

The most important thing is to make sure you do the wire management appropriately. The results are phenomenal. My attached pictures will do more justice than anything I can write.The assembly was easy, and no extra tools were required. Everything you need is in the box. There are two major advantages to this. The biggest one is that you will free up so much desk space for your keyboard/mouse/books. The second is that everything is very easy to adjust in terms of height and tilt. After setting it the way you like it and tightening everything, there is no wobble or cheap feel to this mount. Highly recommend!For reference. In my setup, I have a 27 inch Asus monitor (the one closer to the computer) and a 34 inch LG ultrawide monitor on the other arm. Even though it says it supports monitors up to 32 inches, I was able to place a 34 inch ultrawide on one of the arms with a 27 on the other.</review><review> "Frankly, it is a great stand. Just be careful about the desk you are mounting on. I have a pretty thick desk, and as such the c-clamp wouldn't fit, and the straightbolt mounting would have interfered with the keyboard tray slide (not the products fault). Ever the idiot, and wanting to have it set up fast, I actually bolted the thing straight to my desk through the bracket designed to hold the c-clamp assembly. it ended up working out great! holds all three of my monitors with barely a creak of protest. the arms are STRONG. Frustratingly so, sometimes, as adjusting one monitor may affect it's mirror opposite. up and down is fantastic, as well as panning, but if there is one complaint, whoever assembled the swivel joints mid arm (that come pre-assembled) was the freakin hulk. an allen ratchet, attacted to a c-wrench didn't have the torque required to make the thing budge. The arms still move, but they are sooooo stiff, and I just can't loosen the bolt. Realistically, I don't move my monitors that much, so once i got them in a position I liked, I was done! I do recommend, just prepare for a ton of leftover hardware.", 'This is my first desk mount, and I wish I\'d made the switch sooner. I\'d always used whatever stand the monitor came with until my brother talked me into picking up a mount. It\'s made a world of difference.I\'m 6\'4" tall, and as such, have never had a monitor that could adjust high enough for optimal viewing. This mount changed all that, and more. Not only am I able to position my monitor higher up, bringing my eyes in line with the middle of the screen, but I\'m also able to position my monitor closer to my face for better immersion in single-player games. When I switch to something competitive, I\'m able to push the monitor back so that I\'m better able to see the whole screen. That flexibility alone was worth the price of entry.Assembly and adjustments were easy with this mount, and it includes all necessary tools. I had it attached to my monitor and my desk in less than ten minutes. I went with the c clamp mount, but may ultimately drill a hole in the desk.Materials seem really solid. There\'s some flex in the plastic cable management bits, but that\'s by design. It makes it easier to route the cables themselves.Adjusting the various hinge points in the mount was very simple, although it took a bit of tinkering to dial it in for my 27" monitor. It feels like it\'s on the heavier side, but this mount can apparently handle a lot more. If I dial the tension higher, the mount will spring half-way up even under all that weight.The real test with a product for me is whether I\'d recommend it to a friend. I wouldn\'t even hesitate to recommend this desk mount. It\'s great, and the added flexibility in monitor positioning adds a lot to the PC gaming experience.</review><review> "Pros-Holds 2 monitors-Adjustment range lets you position them any way you want-Includes C-clamp and conversion parts to use with a pre-cut hole-After tightening, everything feels sturdy-Adjustable tension on the arms-Easy Assembly-Includes cable management clipCons-None yet (will update if anything comes up)ThoughtsSo I've got my two monitors set up. I use them mainly for gaming and streaming. One sits directly in front of me, the other angled on my left. To get this orientation, I had to offset the anchor to the left side quite a bit so I could get the desired depth on my main monitor. At first, I tried the anchor in the center, and it was way too close, felt like my eyeballs were melting. After the offset, everything is perfectly and firmly in place. Assembly was a breeze, took all of 20 minutes, and that was mostly finding where I wanted everything. There were no missing parts and the only thing you may need is a philips head screwdriver to attach the brackets to your monitors. Everything else is done with the included alan keys. So far, everything's perfect. My setup is exactly as I pictured it with no monitor stands taking up valuable desk room.*Written November 22, 2019Should something catastrophic happen, or when this system starts to show wear, I'll be sure to update this to get a decent idea of durability.", "Holds up a 32 inch television fine except at full extension in which case the arm drops under the weight but that's okay as I was pushing my luck with this much weight to begin with being slightly heavier than listed specs.

They must have hired a new marketing person, I applaud their actions going back and addressing unhappy customers. A company that stands behind its product is a company I can support. I will come back in April 2021 (18 months warranty period) and update if the replacement unit still works after the warranty period expires.Original Rant:This product functioned fine when I first got it but I think it may be designed to fail after its warranty expires.I had the item in a bin with some other electronics (stored indoors, dry cool location in my office) for a few months not being used... when I took it out to use it again it won\'t power up or do anything. The warranty is only for 18 months and I purchased it 20 months ago.The bestek website item for this product lists it as having a 24 month warranty... yet here on amazon it\'s only 18 months?I contacted the company for a return and they denied me with an insulting "Deeply sorry." message despite me providing pictures of the unit.So I post this review today to warn anybody against purchasing this product. It works fine in the beginning but it will fail you when it matters most and most definitely will not be a useable product 18 months after you purchase it.</review><review> "Good enough for a laptop to charge, which I sometimes use this for when needing to charge my PC on the go while in a car. It's not super warm or loud and it's a fair priced product. I've had no issues with it in the two years I've owned it so I would definitely recommend this inverter to anyone looking for a fair-priced, well-performing inverter as long as 300W is all you need (most laptops don't need more unless you have a high-powered gaming laptop).", "I've used a number of adapter over the years.  Most of them are inconsistent in how well or how long they work.  The Bestek is the best adapter that I've ever had.  I like that it plugs into the car, and has it's own cable that takes the adapter out of the general area of the cigarette lighter.  This cable allows the inverter to be placed in an inconspicuous spot in the back seat where my children will be using it to power their laptops.  I also have to say that this unit was used consistently on a 15 hour drive from Maine to Ohio.  And never once did it lose power.  The unit is powerful with two wall plugs and two USB outlets.  This was well worth the investment.", "Just received the product and so far it works great!  Seems very solid, smaller than I expected (not that I really thought too much about the size), and a good looking unit.Needed it to run fans in my RV when I'm not running the generator.  So far works great.  Used it tonight also to power up a laptop with a dead battery - again, no issues.We will be using it for small items of a similar nature.  I like the power button in the back - so you don't have to remove it from the lighter if you don't want to.Can't speak to maximum power (and will not be using it to a max), or longevity at this time.

Back in the 80s this would have cost a few hundred bucks, if not more. Optical tech has improved by leaps and bounds since then, and for the price, the MicroFlip is impressive as heck.The phone option is nice, too, but we don\'t use it a lot. It\'s just a clip that centers your phone\'s camera over the lens, you\'ll want to use your zoom options on your phone to make it visible. I appreciate the option, it\'s worthwhile and almost-practical, but you get the best fun from looking in the lens directly (it\'s great for viewing at home with several people, hopefully fellow nerds. But it\'s a "field microscope," you want to use it in the field, right? With some twiddling, and care, it works fine for classes and camping if you want to use the phone option.)The slide doen\'t really fit well on the clip. No slides do, in fact. That\'s a little annoying for a field instrument.But, overall, the optical quality is lovely, and the price is right, and it\'s taken a slight beating and survived and still works at 100%. Even if I dropped it and lost it forever somehow, I could still replace it for the cost of coffee, lunch, and gas.Recommended, highly.</review><review> 'The first time the whole thing was missing in the order. Luckily amazon agreed to send another one without me sending the whole package along with my other coffee products back which would take months.The microscope itself is amazing.

My daughter loves it SO much!</review><review> 'I bought this for the kids to mess about with in lockdown. It is very light weight and smaller than my hand. The phone clip came with it as did one glass slide.  I thought that it might be complicated to get it to work with your phone, but it&#8217;s really easy, just put the camera hole of the phone over the microscope viewer and put the phone camera on! Even I could do it!  I didn&#8217;t trust the clip to keep my phone in place securely as it is only just holding on to the very edge of it, so I held it.  Kids aged 9 and 11 were able to use it without much input from me, which is what homeschooling is all about.8The image on the phone is round, which geniuses might have already figured out, but I was expecting a whole screen image because I&#8217;m stupid.Ps I just went back to look at the ad and info film about this microscope and they have full screen images, not just a small round picture.

The second time I used it (at night) it stung even more, but I figured it was still okay, but by the next day when I woke up my chin was itchy and sore.

Does your controller touch pad in the middle make  a loud clicking sound uppon pressing down? If Yes then its a fake, original ps4 controllers have a smooth soft click when pushing down the touch pad2. Original controllers always have an orangy yellowy light turning on and off when charging.. ALWAYS, unless its fully charge. If uppon chargung your controller the light turns orange or yellow then turns off and doesnt keep repeating the process but it is still charging while there is no light to indicate that the controller is charging then its definitely a fake. If you are not to sure, make sure there is only 0,1, or 2 bars left before charging because some controller wont charge if they are at 3 full bars and wont go down a bar untill an hour or 2 pass by depending on the vibration and button movement. To check battery status you can just press and hold the playstation button down.3. And one of my favorites is when you turn on your controller keep an eyes on the light in back of your controller as it lids ups, should take a second or 2 to fully turn on. If it flickers when the light is turning on or the light lags or looks like it struggled to turn fully on, it is 100% fake. Easiest way to spot a counterfit.4. Only for the super fake ones the sony sticker on the back of the controller will not be straight or the sticker on the back is already pealing off on its own.There are other ways to find out if dualshocks are fake but you have to have a little more experiance with fake controllers, if you do have experiance here are some extras in case you dis not know. Make sure your buttons are not sticking out to much and make sure the PS button is not a little off or the texture of the controller is off. Check analog sticks,button texture and the color of the sony sticker in back of the controller between L1 and L2.</review><review> "Bought this as a backup for my original PS4 controller which is still working just fine.  Used lightly for about 30 hours of game play and the problem started.  The left thumb stick does not appear to any longer be returning to center/neutral making it impossible to correctly interact with games as you are unwillingly moved in different directions and are unable to stay still.  Resetting the controller did not correct the issue.  Realize that I am out of the return window so I just bit the bullet and bought another $42 replacement.  I don't think that it is unrealistic to expect the controller to work longer than it did.  Very disappointed.  Keeping my fingers crossed for the new one that just arrive.", "The left analog stick always wears out. You may not notice right away because it doesn't show in all games. In games where the left stick movement is very sensitive, certain directions will cause the character to shuffle their feet repeatedly because the controller's signal constantly shows a strong/weak press alternating. My first controller, this issue was when pressing around 1 o' clock on the analog, the second one is when I press straight to the left.I've never had so many problems with a game system's controller.

For you colourers out there if you wish to use Alcohol Pens then go ahead as an inkjet ink is dye based and as long as you have the standard print setting you shouldn't get any smearing.

Let me be clear: the laptop FITS on the stand, and it holds it up with no problem. The stand seems to be very strong. BUT I noticed that it\'s not balanced and wants to fall off. The bottom of the laptop, at the front, lifts off of the stand no matter how I angle it, and the prongs holding the laptop in place barely even touch the laptop because of that. If I were to angle the screen down, it would be better balanced, but then the laptop stand wouldn\'t be serving the purpose I bought it for and I would still be straining my neck.I wish that the stand had a longer platform and taller prongs (or even ones that curve over the laptop) to keep my laptop balanced. Returning to find one that won\'t have me worried my laptop will fall off.</review><review> 'I have been looking for a decent computer stand. So far, I have 3 of them. One cheap plastic one that I got for $1. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, that one works very well still. It&#8217;s just the angle won&#8217;t let me go down more than 60 degrees. I want to be able to write on my Surface. So, I got a metal one, that that is made for holding books to read. That one works very well. The only thing is that after a while, the thing starts sagging because the bolts are no longer tight. Then I saw this one. It was made for putting a laptop on it. So, I figured it&#8217;d probably be able to support my tablet. It does. I can store a keyboard underneath. It&#8217;s very sturdy. The only thing bad is that it also uses bolts. The only good news is that you can tighten them when they get loose. But, who wants to do that? I don&#8217;t know why no one has made ones with hinges that work on a cog with a little locking mechanism. These nuts or bolt types will all weaken once they are used enough. This thing is made of solid metal. I can write on it and raise it to almost eye level now.

Laptop is small and light, this does exactly what I needed it to - support my laptop in the positions I required next to another monitor.

They allow a good range of movement and keep things where you put them at all times. Happy with my purchase.", 'I use my "Besign LS05 Aluminum Laptop Holder" as a way to have my keyboard at a greater angle than the little flip-out legs can provide.  I have a condition where I need to be reclined while at my desk working from home.  My chair reclines great and I have a wonderful ottoman that fits under my desk which helps a lot.  Basically, I have everything I need EXCEPT I can\'t see my keyboard!  I began looking for ways to adjust it to a better angle and was so happy when I came across the "Besign LS05 Aluminum Laptop Holder".  At first, I was hesitant because most keyboard angle holder things are huge and seem to be at a fixed angle that didn\'t add too much "lift".  Also, I use a Corsair RGB K70 which is a heavier, more solid keyboard than your average light and flimsy ones.  Lastly, all of the reviews were based on using this to hold a laptop and many warned that the small angled "feet" that hold the laptop or in my case, keyboard in place were small.  I\'m very happy that I decided to try this out myself because it is FANTASTIC!  I keep the bottom arm flat on the desk and only angle the top arm to my desired height.  I use it at roughly 45 degrees and the "feet" hold my keyboard from sliding off.  The top panel has pads which keep my keyboard from sliding around and it also has pads underneath to keep it firmly planted on your desk.  While typing, the keyboard doesn\'t wobble and feels very stable.  The arms use bolts which can be tightened with a wrench should they ever become loose.  The feet do not interfere or block access to any keys while typing and I can quickly adjust the angle to fit any situation.  If you\'re looking for a way to adjust the angle of your keyboard and find that those keyboard risers aren\'t very customizable, I strongly recommend giving the "Besign LS05 Aluminum Laptop Holder" a try.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-KAMTRON-Rechargeable-Detection-Waterproof/dp/B086X5F6D2/ref=lp_16225009011_1_6013_cpbg/131-1092198-6472423?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592414&amp;sr=1-6013</link><review> \ "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0This is my third KAMTRON security camera and I love it.Box is very professional and comes nicely packaged. Includes screws and mounting bracket and pieces to make setting it up a breeze.The resolution is great. You can switch between SD and HD to save battery if you would like. I always keep it on HD so I can see things better.I love that I can hear from the camera and talk through the camera. I can tell my dogs to stop digging in the backyard and to get out of the vegetable garden. Ha ha. Sounds is loud on both hearing and speaking.Night vision is great. Better than some of my Ring cameras. Catches movement easily and you can adjust it's sensitivity which is awesome. You can also set it to catch people and to have an alarm go off if you are not home.Setup was super easy. The app actually talks you through the steps and you just scan the QR code and you are good to go. One of the easiest camera setups I've experienced.The cloud feature is nice so I can go back and catch video. I use one of these for my business and it's nice to know that all activity is in the cloud when I need it.One of my other KAMTRON cameras is placed outside and made it through a whole winter with ice, snow and sleet and still works perfectly. I'm pretty sure this one will too as it seems sturdier and the waterproof flap is underneath the camera which keeps it protected.Definitely worth the money!", 'Full disclosure: I received a credit for this device as part of a trial.  That said, I went through the installation without any assistance from Kamtron and am posting this review without allowing editing from them.The camera comes ready to go out of the box following the expected initial charging.  This is a battery operated device and according to the description, should be able to go about 4 months between charges under normal activity levels.  The caveat is that it is motion activated and if it is activated too often as a result, the duration between charges should be proportionately less.  I will amend this review if the charging interval is significantly different.The associated CloudEdge app installed easily from the Apple App Store.  During registration, I actually did read the privacy statements.  I was pleased to see that they were quite reasonable and did not include any use of my data by third parties much less harvesting of my data for direct marketing.  Videos can be stored in their cloud or an an SD Card.  I chose that option and inserted a 32GB SD Card that I had on hand, so videos will be kept on-board.  After powering on the device, I was prompted by the app to point the camera at a QR code which resulted in immediate registration of the camera to the app.I promptly forgot my password, but the &#8220;Forgot password&#8221; option sent me a verification code, from support@ppstrong.com (watch for this to go into your spam folder), which allowed me to create a new password easily.  Part of the problem here was that it did not allow me to copy/paste a password in, the only major weakness I have found so far.  This means that my password generator was useless and I had to select an easy password to be able to type it in by hand.  I would prefer that this field be enabled for copy/paste so that long, complex password can be used.After this initial set-up, the camera started recording perfectly.  The videos are very clear even though I set on SD instead of HD to preserve battery life and storage.  The app offers to notify you each time there is motion detected.  I turned this off soon after installing since I was moving it around a lot in the beginning.You can adjust sensitivity, day/night activity, as well as human detection.  I set sensitivity to low as I don&#8217;t want every movement of a leaf or squirrel to set it off.  I will be checking the activity in the coming days to see how well this works and how many times it activates, but so far, so good.  Another nice adjustment option is a calendar to set which days and/or times you want to capture motion, e.g. on days when you have a lawn service or home repair, you might not want to record anything.The app provides a timeline which allows you to go to a particular moment in time and at a glance to see when activity occurred.  It is a little quirky in that even when you scroll to a particular time, if you don&#8217;t hit the exact time of motion, it jumps to an earlier time.  Overall, even if I had to pay full price for this device, which is competitive with others on the market, I would have given it the same positive review.  Actually, if Amazon allowed it, I would probably give this device a 4.5 instead of a 4.</review><review> 'The camera cam boxed well and included a very nicely put together instruction manual, which I really appreciated. After unboxing the camera which is relatively compact as you can see from the photo, the set up was very easy and painless! I would recommend charging the camera the night before as it can take sometime to fully charge. The picture quality is very nice on both the HD and SD settings, but I refer the HD. The camera also provides great clarity during the day and as well with the night vision, shaded areas also come in nicely. One thing I do appreciate is that the camera sensitivity on the motion can be adjusted, so I&#8217;m not detecting the squirrels that are running around in my backyard during the day. The app is very user friendly and easy to set up, it also allows you to add other devices and share your devices with friends or family members. The installation was was a breeze, but I did find that adjusting the knob to keep the camera in place took a little effort but once in place it holds well. After 72 hours the battery life hasn&#8217;t moved and I would say that it is developed to last a long time on a single charge! I would definitely recommend this camera and pair it with their indoor camera that I bought from amazon.

They are perfect for what I needed. I have them on a 65 inch and I could fit one on both sides vertically and two along the top horizontally. I plugged it right into my TV\'s usb port on the back of the tv so they are powered when the tv is on. No mess of wires at all, not a wire can be seen. The adhesive tape sticks very well no problems at all with it falling off or anything.

Now from 3 to 1After 1 1/2 years: power and menu "buttons" no longer works. Touch screen throws up "phantom" areas on screen which looks like someone is trying to touch there. I had to unplug my touch screen usb to get my monitor back so it\'s useless to me now.  Avoid at all costs.Replacing a laptop and wanted something similar in a touch screen. This fits the bill for me.The con: the power and menu "buttons". There were no buttons only touch areas. The markings for them were almost invisible. To find them I had to turn off the monitor (glare) and use a bright light and magnifying glass to find the markings. I had to put a dot on each mark with a silver metallic marker to be able see them while using the monitor. After re-reading and studying the manual I found the outside two buttons are 1 &amp; 2 and the inside 2 are the scroll buttons. Thankfully after setting up the monitor I will probably never have to use these again2 day update. Window task bar cannot be accessed by touch no mater which edge of the screen you put it on - only by mouse. And the sound is really bad. If you get this plan on having another source for your sound.</review><review> 'I regularly have meetings in my office. The problem with a standard desktop setup is that traditional monitors are large, bulky and completely block the view of people you interface with for meetings and sit-downs. I have been looking for a monitor that can be adjusted to lay flat when someone comes to sit across from me. The Planar Helium 22" screen is the solution I\'ve been looking for.Functionality: The monitor is easily adjusted from the back lays down as I need it to. No fuss and is fast to adjust. The Helium stand retracts back up on its own when you adjust it to a proper viewing angle for work. I will most likely rarely use it in a flat position, but it\'s there if I need it. I have a 55" tv in my office that I often use to present work related material to my staff and clients, and being able to use this combination works perfectly for my needs. I absolutely love it.Touch Screen: A bonus is the touch screen. It\'s super responsive and easy to use. Very much like a tablet. I have yet to experience any delay or unresponsiveness when pressing on the screen. Also, it\'s accurate. I didn\'t buy this monitor for the touch panel functionality, but I can see how this will be beneficial moving forward.Screen Quality: I do a mix of work. Lots of the usual email reading, Microsoft Office work as well as graphic design, photography and video work. The colors and crispness of the monitor are excellent. Text is sharp and vivid as are the colors. The screen is reflective, not matte. I don\'t have too much light in my office so reflective light is not an issue for me. Plus, glossy screens add punch and contrast which is what I like. Very much like Apple laptops and iMacs. Also, the screen is bright. Out of the box, the screen is more on the blue side but is easily adjusted using the in-menu Blue Light Reducer options. Works like a charm. Another thing to note is the bezel. It\'s very thin which makes gives me a large viewing area without the excessive bezel size. The equates to a smaller footprint and takes up very little space on my desk. I really like that.Cons: the panel does not have 100% even light near the edges. This is common in many monitors. Although not very noticeable, this may be a deal breaker for folks needing to have a very accurate monitor for design and creative work. Also, the panel has limited viewing angles from the sides, but the viewing angles from the top and bottom are fine, which is good since this is a tiltable monitor and is intended to be viewed from a flat and upright position.All in all, a very good monitor that fits my needs and recommend it to anyone needing a laptop with that can lay flat when needed and takes up very little space on the desk. Please see the attached photos for my setup and how I use it.</review><review> 'Great clarity, brightness, volume, and touch response. Well built. Nice thin bezel. Lost a star because the description is incorrect and the controls are touch instead of tactile push. This does NOT come with Helium stand and is NOT a USB 3.0 hub and does NOT have DVI input. The stand is a kick out single hinge as shown in the main image. Still worked well for me.</review><review> "I originally had a Planar PXL2230, which lasted a couple of years, but the touch worked pretty well, and it also worked with Microsoft Surface Pro pens. That one started to fade, and the touch started to fail in the top right corner. I liked the pen touch, and finger touch, so I bought the 2430 version. That monitor was worse. It must have thought I was barely alive as the touch didnt work well. The screen was nice and bright though, and the monitor was pretty heavy. That lead me to buy the 2435, which uses a different touch method, that doesn't work with Surface Pro pens, but the monitor is nice and bright and the touch is excellent. It's also a couple of pounds lighter than the 2430, which made it easier to keep steady on the monitor VESA mount I use. Also the bezel is only on the bottom, and pretty much edge to edge on the other 3 sides, making it take less space.I like this monitor, wish it would work with a Microsoft pen. It does work with those fat rubber tipped touch pointers, but you can't draw effectively with those. I would recommend it. It's at a good price point too for a touch.", "Yea I was very disappoint with this product. I'll start with the good thing about this monitor then move into the issues I had with it. For the price that I paid it was a great deal for a 27 inch touch screen. It looked nice and clean similar to a Apple monitor but thicker border around the screen. The stand attached to the back is strong and allows for extreme angle placement.Now for my issues. This thing is heavy. It weights as much as my iMac but that thing has a Hard Drive, a GPU and a whole computer. If all you wanted it for was a second monitor, then hook it up via HDMI and you gravy. But this is a touch screen monitor. That's why I got it. Here I am thinking it's a plug and play or a simple download of the driver from the site. Oh no. The driver for this model is not on the website so you have to search. I was very disappointed and discouraged but nonetheless continued.Finally found the driver for this model from someone else and tadah...happy as a clam until I looked closely at what was required of me. This particular driver cost about $120.I returned the unit.

Not even USB 1.0 speed. The first one I used to transfer some photos took almost 35 minutes to load 345 images totaling 80.6 MB. Thinking it was a bad unit I tried the next one with very consistent results. I formatted all 5 units and proceeded to do some comparison testing. Across 3 computers and using 2.0 and 3.0 ports. I got varying times of up to 54 minutes for the same file mentioned above. I tried each unit with word documents as well that measured less than 100Kb and those went in a flash no pun intended. Music, photos, any file over 5MB just jams these units up, and they bog down. I tried the same testing with an old USB 2.0 / 32gb SanDisk Cruzer Glide that I had and it smashed right through the file averaging 25 to 30 seconds on the photo file on repeated tries. So not a bottleneck on the 3 computers. Checking for software updates showed none available. Running a check on the PNY units for errors shown none. They are just slow as frozen molasses running uphill at Christmas time. I guess if you are just storing small files then they will work. If you plan on taking advantage of the 32 GB capacity in my opinion I would not order them if you are over 65.

These little covers are *impossible* to remove by hand. What seems to jam them up is the little tab on each side of the drive. The tab is supposed to slide in a matching groove (for alignment I guess?) but instead jams it up. By the 3rd drive, I'd gotten it to a 30 second process to remove wherein I pried each side with a small flathead screwdriver until the clear plastic stretched away from the drive.

The cartridges which came with the machine lasted an incredibly short time.  I went to a local Office Depot to get replacement ink, but it was not in stock.  I went to Amazon to get cartridges 288XL.  The genuine Epson cartridges were not immediately available, but generic ink cartridges for the XP-430 were available for less than half the price of the Epson ink.  I ran the printer, and it printed flawlessly using generic ink all purchased through Amazon.  A few days back there was a big notice on my computer that my printer required a firmware update.  It was working fine so I was leery, but I am a CPA and this is tax season, so I let it download the firmware update.  Upon completion of the update all of a sudden the printer did not recognize Any of the Just Replaced ink cartridges which I had used for less than a day.  THIS IS A HEADS UP TO ANY OWNER OF EPSON XP-430 USING GENERIC INK... DO NOT INSTALL THE FIRMWARE UPDATE.  This situation shut down the printer completely, it could no longer even scan. I think  We the consumers, should be able to determine for ourselves whether we are willing to risk voiding the warranty by using affordable ink, not supplied by Epson.  I am surprised it is legal for Epson to notify users an upgrade to the firmware is required, only to disable their printer, but that is what has happened.</review><review> "Under no circumstances should you even consider buying an Epson 434 printer which will only use these 288 and 288xl cartridges unless you want to take a part time job simply paying for the ink. Even on standard setting, I'm getting a fraction of the use that they advise. Profoundly expensive. I paid $49 for the printer and have spent easily $100 on ink products in about 6 weeks. I'm trashing the whole project.", 'Bought this for my Epson XP-430. I happened to have used up all the black ink doing an overload of printing and with over 60% of all the colors left, decided to just purchase black. After seeing how expensive the "high capacity" ink was that was recommended I was very hesitant as the printer itself is only $100. After searching, I saw that there is very little aftermarket ink and only these models work for the XP-430.  Spending so much on all new ink seemed insane, that is until I saw the standards for a third of the price which seemed more reasonable. Now according to the Epson packaging and website, high capacity has 2.5 times more ink than standard, which I\'d say logically make standard a slightly better deal. But after a couple weeks of use I have questioning as it does not even seem as if there is 250% more ink. Although I do not have the software required to take measurement of these things I\'d recommended going with the standard capacity until these amounts are proven.</review><review> "These ink cartridges dry up after a few months.  At least for me, as I only need to print a couple pages every once in a while.Now after never even printing in color, my Epson printer is claiming that my color cartridges are empty and must be replaced before it will print anything even in grayscale.  It won't print a single page of black text.  And I discovered that right after I just bought two more black cartridges.  Yay.I am switching back to Canon and never looking back.  I do find some comfort thinking of the Epson company dying a sad embarrassing death like HP.  (Not that they are dying because I'm no longer a customer, but because there are surely thousands or millions of other people making the same decision.)", "I installed my new ink today, and printed a test page. I went on to print the things I needed printed, and it told me I was running low on all three of the colors I just replaced. All three of them! Screen shot attached. Returning this product isn't an easy process so I'm leaving this review with the hopes that Amazon or EPSON will do something to remedy the situation.", "These cartridges were unusable -- smeary and had gaps, and no amount of cleaning heads or printing results would fix it.  Because I had opened new box FIVE weeks after ordering instead of four, they take no responsibility for the defect.  Come on, ink cartridges?  Who doesn't keep them unopened for a month as backup.  Sometimes there are defects, but to expect all supplies to be opened and used in 30 days?  Not standing behind their product at all.", "I have an EPSON XP-340I read a comment on here that stated that these cartridges have chips in them (they do) that count how many sheets of paper is printed to determine whether ink needs to be replaced and not when the ink is actually low or empty. So when I read all the comments about trying to see if another color ink cartridge would work in the empty one place I needed to try and see. I figured after doing what I Did below that the counting print pages has some truth to it.So Mallory last comment had me thinking, what if I put in another cartridge into the slot....Well I keep all my old cartridges and I found a red one (I was out of) AND I replaced it with the old one. And it worked.Not sure how long it will last but now I'm able to finish my work without having to pull out my old HP just yet.I was going to try black but seen the red cartridge and used that instead. So im not sure how that would work.Try at your own risk.", 'Aside from ink running out incredibly fast and never printing the amount of sheets advertised, the ink levels will drop even if you use NO INK. Epson inkjet printers are made to make you overuse and throw away ink, and pay FULL PRICE for it. Every single time you use any kind of "maintenance" function on the printer whether it be a tiny printed symbol for calibration or cleaning the ink header, the "ink levels" it shows will drop DRASTICALLY. If your printer malfunctions and prints 50 pages BLANK, the chips will still read this as using the ink even though no ink was used. You also CANNOT print black and white if colour cartridges need to be changed. It will not function until an "empty" cartridge is replaced, and not only that, but it will also automatically USE your coloured ink when printing in black and white. Printer companies, ESPECIALLY EPSON are scamming you out of your money with these inkjet products.If you mainly print black and white you will save so much money by purchasing a decent monochrome laser-printer for around double the price of the cheap printers that use this ink. If you absolutely need to print colour on a day-to-day basis, do a lot of research and try to find a higher quality inkjet printer that is well-reviewed (printer and cartridges). It might seem like a nice deal buying a $50-60 printer until you realize you have to pay the same amount every month for the ink.I\'ve been scammed and I have learned from my mistake, and I hope whoever is reading this will learn from my mistake too and make a better choice.</review><review> "I am trapped as a consumer into purchasing this company's highly expensive colored water cartridges.

I've had to factory reset it half a dozen times because apps stop working or other issues crop up.I've also owned a couple of Fire 7 inch tablets and a couple of Samsung 7 inch tablets.  The Fires have been passed on to my kids;  one of the Samsungs bricked after a year of use, the oldest one is still going strong.

Even after a final, frustrating factory reset it was just slow and wonky.I understand that the Fire HD8 is 4 years old at this point - but it was never super fast and always had some measure of these frustrations.Another thing that I love - the Vankyo does not come loaded with a ton of bloatware.  Hallelujah!Oh - and a couple of bonuses - it comes with a screen protector installed, and it fits my old Fire case with a couple of small modifications - I had to use a single hole punch to get the headphone jack and power button to be completely uncovered.

Dropping this to 4 stars as now that I have been using it,  the Wi-Fi just seems to be a marginal when any distance away from an access point.  Still happy with the purchase, but RF sensitivity seems only average to below average. I had been looking at low-cost Android tablets with internal GPS to run some navigation apps while boating and came across the Vankyo 8" that had decent reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  First, out of the box, this appears to be a reasonably well-made tablet and was quite easy to set up and get connected via Wi-Fi.  It is a solid performer as a tablet and has all the basics covered quite well.  When I finally got around to loading the GPS apps, the internal GPS did not appear to connect to any satellites up to the point that I began to doubt if it even had an internal GPS receiver.  I nearly put it back in the box for a return but before I did, I left it running for a about 10 minutes and in that time, it did suddenly began receiving and locked to GPS navigation satellites.  It must have needed some time to initialize the GPS receiver as now it seems to have no problem connecting with GPS.  While this is not true sunlight readable display, (I didn&#8217;t expect it to be), it does appear to be as bright as my iPad but not as quite as bright as my Samsung Galaxy S8 phone.  I found a good shock proof case on Amazon specific for the Vankyo 8&#8221; that I highly recommend that fits well.  I was torn between giving this a 4 or a 5 overall, but I will go ahead and give it a 5 as it has met or exceeded all my expectations for its usability at a truly great price point.  The only drawback I have noticed is not support for 5 GHz specific Wi-Fi (802.11ac support) which has not hampered me as the 2.4GHz support appears solid.  Also, the GPS appears to track fewer Satellites (typically only up to 12) and does take longer to synch for navigation than my Samsung phone, but the good news is it does work once it connects.The good:Later version of Android (9.0 Pie)Good response, no lagBright crisp screenDual CameraDoes have built in support for GPSThe not so good:Does not appear to support 5 GHz Wi-FiGPS is not as fast to sync as other internal GPS receivers I have used.</review><review> "I use tablets for discrete purposes around the house.

All you have to do is use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the knobs on the valves.  Then unscrew the brass nut that secures it to the front of the stove.  Now back out the valve stem using the knob and remove the stem that has two O rings and the brass needle valve.  Take a clean paper towel and wipe the gunk or the valve lube off of the O rings thoroughly.  I blame the lube for the problem.  The rings were in good condition.  I then applied a tiny amount of silicone based plumber's grease, but you have to be sure you don't use one that is petroleum jelly or it can ruin the rubber.  I bought a tube for a few bucks on Amason.  Then I twisted some of the paper towel into a point and swabbed out the inside of the valve, but don't leave any paper in there or you are in trouble.  Don't use a Q tip either or the fuzz may come off in there.  Here is link for the silicone lube:https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFUPC/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1I didn't put too much lube on the O rings, and with my fingers I wiped it around the rings leaving only a light coat.  Then reassemble.  Now the valves can be adjusted neatly and precisely to reduce flame for simmering and easier control.  I don't know if the factory used a valve lube that gives the valve that rubbery feeling that makes it hard to set the flame precisely, but once I did this operation the stove is a pleasure to use.  If it needs to be repeated the job takes only a few minutes with few tools.  Hope everyone finds this post without having to go through the learning curve.  Please give a thumbs up to save everyone some trouble.  I changed my review now from 1 star to 4 star and think in the long run this is the best propane camp stove out there and will last longer than my Blue Rhino...which was good but the regulators flake out much too soon to be considered a good long term stove.

I have electric heat and an electric stove/oven.  Needless to say, not a good situation, especially that for two days the roads were blocked by downed trees.  All I had to cook with with a BBQ without the side burner, making my cooking options limited at best. Once electric, internet, and cellular service were restored in my area, I immediately ordered this.Setting it up was very easy.  I also got the matching  Coleman 5-Ft.

I hooked this to a 20-lb propane tank, which turning/screwing it in COUNTER-CLOCKWISE into the opening of the 20-lb tank.  It quickly attached, and the rest of this went together quickly.Operation:It was a little windy and the temps outside were 32 degrees according to the thermometer on my deck.  I boiled a small pot of water in 8 minutes.  Works very good and burns so clean that you will have a hard time seeing the flame when the sun is out.Shutdown was easy.  I let it cool and I packed it up.  What is nice is that valve and the accessory Coleman 5-Ft. High-Pressure Propane Hose and Adaptor fit inside the grill and you can lock then up inside it so no worries about losing anything.  There is a little handle on it to carry it.I recommend it.

To be honest I was skeptical at first due to some reviews. After using them myself for a couple weeks I could not be happier. These cameras were extremely easy to set up. Turned them all on near the router and downloaded the app. Within 10 minutes they were all connected to my wifi.--Install--The longest part was figuring out where to install. Installing them is easy, just make sure you got decent wifi signal and plug it in. Yes, like other reviewers stated the power cord is not very long. Maybe ~10ft or so. This makes it so you will probably need to use some sort of extension cords. But nonetheless as long as you expect it, it should not be a surprise.**Update 12-18**As mentioned the cord is short so you need to plug it in close to power source. I found I very simple fix for this. if you search Micro usb Male to Female Extender Cord. Any cord with that setup will extend the length of your cord, I bought a 16.5ft one for around $10. easy peasy.--APP--Alot of reviewers complained about the application for zmodo. I found the app to be very easy to use with a lot of different settings and options for the camera. Maybe the app was recently updated, I am not sure. But my experiecnce with the app so far is great. I occasionally notice minor bugs in which i notfify support right there on the app. It is nice someone is always there to answer questions.--Motion--Again, I was worried about buying these because people complained about motion detection, which is most important feature. If you follow the instructions for install there will be no issues with motion. I have tested my setup multiple times and the motion is always working. Hell, it even sometimes goes of if tree branches blowing around in the wind. One of the top reviewers stated "i feel less safe". I have no idea how that is even possible. The motion works if set up properly.  Even if some chance it misses a motion the fact you have cameras is a huge crime deterrent. Plus if you are worried about motion alerts you can always buy the cloud which has now been released for 24/7 recording. I feel the cloud is over priced for my budget at around $7 a month per camera I believe, but hopefully that cost will go down.I initially did have an issue where I was not getting motion alerts but I found it was user error. In the app you can click to say if you are home, away, sleeping, etc. Each of those options has specific alert settings. My "home" setting was default to not give motion alerts. This is easy to change but if you are not aware it may confuse you.Overall I am very pleased with this system. You can definitely not find a better system for the price. With the new cloud feature, you can\'t go wrong. I have no issues with motion where my cameras are installed and the setup and install was a breeze. I did not post pictures/video for privacy concerns. Any questions feel free to ask!**UPDATE**7-8-18I have had these cameras for almost a year now. They are still going great and everything stated above is accurate. In the past year, I have caught on video a hit and run accident which occurred outside my house on the street. I was also able to assist police in getting video footage of a possible suspect in a burglary which occurred at my neighbor\'s house. The motion alerts are still going as expected and I am pleased with them. I do wish the motion alerts recorded longer than the 8sec or so. The app is still working perfectly for me with no issues and seems to be getting updates very regularly.***Update 11-23-18***I recently had a bike stolen out of my garage. My camera I have set up back there caught them on video running from my garage with the bike. I also found them up front scoping out my house (they apparenty did not do very good if they did not see the cameras). The bike was only around $100 value to me but I posted the video on facebook and someone was able to identify the suspects from watching the zmodo video. It was super easy to download video to my phone and post on facebook. I was in contact with police and am happy to say the suspects are caught and my bike was returned all in less than a week thanks mainly to zmodo. Now that being said I did miss some important motion alerts fro the incident but got what I neded. I am highly considering getting the 24/7 cloud recording. I have not had a major issue with motion alerst but I know it does not get everything. I am hoping to purchase a 5th camera for the holidays to get even more protection.</review><review> "Love love love these!!!!

If you just use the default driver, Ethernet speed is very limited; with the right driver, performance is great. So far, no other glitches of any kind.My only suggestion for improvement is the design of the metal case. The sharp edges, and especially corners, are annoying and not conducive to leaving in a backpack with other gear. I have an older Amazon Basics USB3.0 Ethernet adapter that nailed it in this regard. From an industrial design standpoint, this is a step backward. This is the reason I only gave it 4 stars.

For instance, I charged my XPS13 to 100% battery, put it in hibernation mode, and left this Internet cable plugged in.  Eight hours later, I was down to 30% of battery.  So you can use this for short times on battery power, or you have to use it when your portable is plugged in.  But if you use it more than that, your battery won't last.

However the keyboard itself is working.  So I'm not sure what is causing that particular issue.  The most frustrating issue so far is that my Plantronics BT600 wireless headset behaves wonky when I plug the USB dongle into this hub.  When I plug the same dongle into an Amazon Basics single port USB C to A adapter it behaves just fine.  But, this hub does not seem to provide enough power to run the network interface, keyboard, and the Plantronics USB dongle all at the same time.

Some may disagree with me on that statement, but I don't play many games myself.  I just wanted a replacement keyboard and mouse which is wired, and this does the trick, and at a cheaper price than combos that aren't RGB.Also if you're worried about the brightness of the RGB being emitted, no worries there!  I turned off my lights and tried to see if those lights would bother me in another room, and they're not bright enough to bother you for sleeping.  Also you can turn both of the RGB lights off if they're bothersome for you.  The keys have a great feel for typing and the keyboard has to tabs on the bottom to elevate it if you were curious. If this is something for home office or gaming that you need, then get it, you won't go wrong here!", 'This is my second purchase of a Havit mechanical KB and mouse combo.  The first one was with a palm rest, it was a PC setup for a family, and it was excellent, they loved it.  I have another build and my nephew doesn&#8217;t like using a palm rest, so I decided to get him this combo instead.  It is a good discount without the palm rest.I wish the packaging opens from the top and not from the sides.  Keyboards + mouse are easier to unbox that way.  But other than that, this combo is excellent.  Once you take these out of the box, the first thing you&#8217;ll notice is how premium quality this product is.  The aluminum top frame feels very rigid and won&#8217;t bend under pressure.  The keycaps are made of plastic with a matte finish.  Comparatively, my primary KB has smooth keycaps and they retain skin oils.  So, this matte finish is easier to maintain and clean.  The blue switches are really clicky, majority of gamers love clicky keys.  But these keys are a little softer to press compared to mainstream mechanical KB blue switches.  But tactile feedback is still excellent.  Testing this KB + mouse combo on some FPS game gave surprising results.  Feedback is good and no key delays or lag.  I&#8217;m not a big fan of RGB lights, I just set them to &#8220;breathing&#8221; mode and forget about it.  This KB+mouse combo has customizable RGB lights.  You can customize them using software, but you can also change them using the FN keys, no need to install additional software.  Same thing with the mouse that has a button to change RGB style.  You can change the DPI settings on the fly on the mouse to 6 different settings, but there is no default for 1200 DPI which most gamers use, the next best thing is 1600 DPI which is only a very small difference in my opinion.  I was able to game with this keyboard for 2 hours straight without any problem.  Performance wise, it only took a few minutes until I got used to the feel of the keyboard and mouse and back to my gaming style.Overall, this combo is an excellent option for budget gaming builds.  They perform on par with those $100+ branded ones.  If you prefer a keyboard with palm rest, then look for their other variant for an additional cost, but if you&#8217;re ok without a palm rest, this combo is for you.  Will I buy this again?  Well, this is my second set for another build, so yes.  Highly recommended.</review><review> 'UPDATE:After several months of use, the keyboard works fine, however performance is faltering.I notice ghosting from time to time as well as multiple keystrokes popping up when I only press a key once.No water damage/food has been in or on the keyboard either.RGB functions fine still.I am currently typing my review with this keyboard.First impressions are very good,Good build quality for the price, responsive and similar switches to cherry mx blueI cannot speak for durability over time as I have just started using it but I doubt I will ever take a key switch to true failure.RGB is vibrant and has some cool built in programmed lighting effects.Overall, I would highly recommend this keyboard to a friend looking for someone looking for a budget mechanical keyboard.I have yet to use the mouse yet as I have a high end gaming mouse that I love.</review><review> "This is probably an item that a youtuber will review this and the price will go up like $60 more. This mouse is good for gaming and everything the keyboard is super responsive and keys do not wobble.

The only bad thing about this is that you can't set the keyboard to one colour and their isn't much colour options for the mouse but there is good options for the mouse but considering the price I would expect that. My expectations were low but I was shocked this is a nice christmas present if you wanna give it to somebody.

Then, I bought two more receivers and transmitted to a projector over the altar and to a TV in the foyer behind a brick wall with sound proof sheathing and initially had pixilation, but after adjusting the position of the transmitter and the receiver antenna's, all three (2 TV's and a Projector) were streaming away in full 1080P resolution.  The TV's are 70 ft line of site &amp; 85 ft behind brick wall away and the Projector is about 30 ft line of site.  I called Tech Support at J-Tech and confirmed they could not guarantee transmissions to 3 receivers, but I would say if you have unobstructed signal to all three they will do it.  If there is an obstruction, try transmitter location and antenna positioning (the kit came with an external extender antenna base for added flexibility and improved signaling around obstacles), it solved my problem rather quickly.  I'm so excited to finalize the installation &amp; implement this solution in our church's environment and not have to run unsightly cables long distances through the sanctuary, plus, HDMI is limited to about 50ft and other cabling standards require converters anyway.  Radio transmission and reception is the way to go for a clean, professional looking install of communication based equipment.  My only wish would be for J-Tech to offer a transmitter that would broadcast to more than 2 or 3 receivers.  I've got a need to broadcast to 2 more TV's and trying to avoid HDMI splitters and long cables.

G-sync compatible, small bezel, matte finish screen, great colors.There are a lot of reviews mentioning washed out colors, a few notes on that.1) Out of the box my brightness was near full blast--through the built in monitor menu I pushed it down to about 502) By default windows typically runs monitors at 60hz even if they can do more, through Windows you have to switch it to 144hz--and this improves the quality of the colors drastically. Running it lower than 144hz through Windows will wash out the colors, it was built for 144, not window\'s default 60. The images I included shows the steps to do so.3) Through the monitor menu I switched it to "Gamma 3" preset, it added some extra saturation--I am the type of person that typical prefers slight over saturation so that added the extra "oomph" I enjoy.I\'m a designer for a living and with those 3 steps, I felt I\'ve achieved near "accurate" colors that I am use to seeing. (Such as Facebook blue, Coke red, ect.Another note: For g-sync to work you need a display port cable, not the HDMI cable it comes with.If you want a decent monitor and you currently prefer &gt;60fps over 1440p/4k resolution, this is a great option without breaking the bank.Con: The matte screen has a bit of a grainy look, mostly noticeable on solid white pages.</review><review> "This is honestly one of the best budget 144hz monitors out there.

When typing or moving my mouse the whole screen shakes and I'm kind of disappointed that they couldn't have at least made the whole stand metal as to properly support the weight of the panel. The cable management hole in the stand is a nice bonus and the directional stick behind the monitor is a great, intuative alternative to buttons on the side of the monitor.

Functionally it seems to be a decent product (nice wrist support and pad design) but it has this smell that has, so far, made it unusable because it triggers my allergies and results in a headache. The odor reminds me of hay or some similar dried field crop. My grandparents were farmers and I loved visiting the barn and hay loft as a child. However, I do not live on a farm now and cannot tolerate this smell in my home. Am hoping it goes away - very soon.November Update -- Customer support contacted me almost immediately after I posted my review. They have sent the newer version as a replacement and I am happy to report the smell is gone and I'm pleased w/ the product. My suggestion is: if you have any sensitivity to smells, I would buy the newer and slightly more expensive version ($1 or so).", "This was a great value and it's well made. It just seems like the gel arm rest is a little small. Maybe I just need to just get used to it. I received an email instructing me not to remove the plastic film from the back of the mouse pad or it would stick to my table surface. I literally needed to though as it was bubbled up and the pad wouldn't lay flat without removing It. It would have been nice to have instructions saying so with the mouse pad.

It still had a *mild* chemical odor, which is why it lost one star, but the replacement mouse pad was MUCH improved over the first one. After removing it from the package, I simply let it air out for a few days on newspaper, and the chemical smell faded so it's fine now. This seems to be a well-constructed item, it's got ample space for mousing, and it supports my hand and wrist nicely. The customer service was excellent!

I&#8217;ve had it for about a month and some change now, and couldn&#8217;t be happier.

It is very sticky on the bottom...which is good...but sometimes a bit of a pain - because I can't just slide it anymore...I literally have to kind of peel it up to move.  This is fine, actually, but I do wonder how long it will last because of the tackiness.  I'll find out over time, but I can say that it is an excellent mouse pad, and I've been enjoying the improved efficiency and performance of my mouse because of it!", 'the arm rest is good and does its job well, but the mouse pad area is too small.

This product serves the purpose and I do not get hand pains owing to continuous usage of the mouse anymore. So ergonomic thing works perfectly well. There are few noticeable drawbacks though1. The area where the mouse can be used is quite small. So, its strictly for work stations where you do not use much mouse or if you use you do not move the mouse a lot from its base position.2.With continuous usage, the area holding your wrist starts getting warmer and the mousepad becomes uncomfortable to use. I hope in ac rooms this issue would not happen but once this starts happening you cannot use the mousepad at all.

Also it is NOT smudge proof, as a matter of fact it's so bad that it didn't hurt my feelings at all to remove the plastic face cover from the frame after I scratched the heck out of it when trying to separate it.  Do not believe the internet videos that  show the separation being so easy.  If you plan on throwing in your purse or pocket with keys you will have damage pretty much right away.

My daily driver is a TI-Nspire CX ii CAS. I've had an HP Prime and a Casio fx-cg500, all CAS calculators, but the best is the TI. As for the TI-84 Plus CE - I really like the looks and the colors; I just had to have one. Sadly, the functionality does not live up to its looks, and certainly not its price! The scientific functions are about the same as would be found in a Casio FX-115 ES Plus for less than $20. To be fair, the 84 has some great statistics functions. But let's get to the graphing.The TI-84 Plus CE has a very nice, large color display, but in graph mode, the graphing area is significantly reduced, as are the graph analysis tools - most of which are missing altogether. Come on TI, this is near your top of the line non CAS grapher and it is no better capability than a $39 Casio grapher.Speaking of things missing, where is the backspace key? The line editor is in character overwrite mode by default. Editing a previously used equation/expression is a pain.This is turning into a rant, so I'll quit. It is clear that TI designed this calculator specifically for high school students and to fleece said students/parents out of some serious bucks! At best, this is a $50 calculator and performs like one.I'll end on a positive note - connecting the 84 to a PC using TI's free TI Connect is easy. The 84 is programmable using TI Basic and assembly language. I've not tried the latter. The TI Connect software contains a programming editor, although programming on the calculator itself is not difficult for short programs. If you really like programming your calculator, this is a good choice. There are tons of programs, so peer to peer support is good. The bottom line is that if you are going to pay this kind of money for a grapher, then buy the TI-Nspire CX II CAS. It's 3 times the calculator and the best out there.", "My hubs bought this for me, as I needed a graphing calculator for school... and BOY, OH BOY! This puppy does it all! It's thin and light weight compared to all of the other TI-calculators I've used/tested. It has the ability to perform advanced Trigonometry, Precalculus, Calculus I/II/III, and *some* Chemistry and Physics functions. The color/backlighting feature comes in handy when graphing -- you can color-code different functions and the calculator will color-coordinate lines to match what you're doing (easy differentiation!). Have I mentioned the battery?! This calculator holds its charge like a BEAST! It's crazy... I keep the backlighting set moderately high, the thing stays in my backpack, I use it a lot (I'm a Biochem/ChemE student) and honestly, it holds its charge for MONTHS at a time. I was skeptical about the purchase, I read reviews and was on the fence because of the price... But, man... Totally satisfied!", "Love it! For the price, you get a great rechargable, color, graphing calculator.  Battery has held out for more than 3 months of fairly regular use.Only negative... It has some weird form of a USB plugin that isn't common anymore. When i lost it, I had to scrounge to find a replacement.", "Was hesitant to buy product due to some reviews claiming they received a used product. Calculator's packaging was not damaged, but when opened there were small scratches on the calculator and near some buttons. When I fully inspected, it was very clean. Not sure if it was used as some think. It came promptly and my daughter has had no complaints thus far as to function."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Dove-Body-Wash-Gentle-Exfoliating/dp/B0017P7BOA/ref=lp_16225006011_1_1623_m/138-8994255-6395559?s=beauty-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605595112&amp;sr=1-1623</link><review> \ 'Fortunately for the environment and unfortunately for me, this is the &#8220;new&#8221; formula and the old formula is no longer available.

I was surprised to discover that the three NF-A14 fans I received from Amazon were made in China, whereas the 2 fans purchased previously (as well as multiple other Noctua fans and CPU coolers I have purchased in the past) have all been made in Taiwan. Now the actual location made is not that critical to me *so long as* the products are the same high quality that Noctua is known for. So I am disappointed to find that the 3 fans that were made in China are of noticeably inferior quality to the fans made in Taiwan. I have attached several comparison pictures.Noted differences:1. The fan blades on the Taiwan made fans are noticeably smoother and more rounded than the ones made in China, which have rough edges at points.2. The "Flow Acceleration Channels" on the blades of the Taiwan fans are much more defined than the channels on the made in China fans; the channels on the Chinese fans are barely raised from the blades.3. The "Inner Surface Microstructures" of the made in Taiwan fans have a distinct waterdrop shape, whereas the made in China fans just have a shallow triangular cutout.4. There is a noticeable difference in frame color (see images). The problem with the difference is that the fans do not match the other Noctua case and CPU cooler fans in the 3 builds that I am putting together, as all the other fans were made in Taiwan.5. The made in China fans have a noticeably louder droning sound when spinning at the same RPM as the other fans.I communicated these differences with Noctual Cooling Solutions and they claim that the differences are within their manufacturing tolerances and do not affect performance. But Noctua is known for its reputation of highest quality and attention to details, and I\'m sure that Noctua engineers designed all these tiny details to exacting specifications in order to obtain the best possible performance, so it concerns me to see such visually noticeable differences, even if I do not have the instrumentation to measure the impact.The biggest issue is that if there are such obvious visible differences in exterior quality, I am concerned that there is also a difference in quality in the internal motor, which I cannot see. It is not something that I want to discover down the line after the fans have been installed and used for some time.</review><review> 'I bought so many fans and cooling solutions from Noctua and never been disappointed before.This is the third 140mm fan from Noctua that I bought, this time it arrived Made in China, which is a certain no for me.Although the fan does perform very well, there are a lot of cosmetic imperfections as a difference in color, uneven finish, rounded edges.They never advertised the product as Made in Taiwan or not Made in China, but when you are selling a product as a "Premium" one and the price certainly it is, they should never let their quality, performance nor cosmetic, go down, it is like buying a second tier Noctua products and they didn\'t even lower their prices.In the past, their fans were my first choice, it didn\'t matter the price, from now on, they will not be my first choice anymore.I will be looking for other brands for fans and cooling solutions.</review><review> 'Maybe you read the product description and aren\'t sure what, "turbulence to the influx in order to facilitate the transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow, which reduces tonal intake noise, improves flow attachment and increases suction capacity" means.  That\'s okay.  All you need to know is that there\'s a reason these fans are so highly rated.All of my case fans, in all of my computers, are Noctua\'s.  I replaced my Corsair AF140s with these.  I replaced my NZXT FN V2 fans with these.  I replaced a lot of different brands\' fans with these.  Neither of the aforementioned brands\' fans are bad, either;  they\'re just not *as* good.The cooling performance is top notch, but what really makes them shine is the noise ( or lack thereof ).  These ( and Noctua fans in general ) are really the only choice for a quiet PC build that doesn\'t compromise on cooling capabilities. Yes, they\'re more expensive, but they\'re more expensive for a reason.  And really, we\'re talking about, what,  ~$5 difference in price?  Skip the Starbucks for a day and you\'re covered.  Seriously.  It\'s worth it.10 / 10 will continue to buy for every PC build going forward</review><review> "The NF-A14 PWM is the best all-around 140mm fan in the world, even better than its more expensive brother, the iPPC variant.There are a few points that are worth knowing:1: Quiet. Like all tan and brown Noctua products, the NF-A14 PWM is borderline silent in almost all uses. The beauty of this is that it requires no knowledge, or specialized software/hardware, to get it to run appropriately. Simply plug it into a PWM-enabled fan header and let the computer run it. It'll be silent or near silent in almost all conditions.2: Powerful. This fan produces excellent pressure and airflow. Unlike the 120mm fan Noctua equivalents, the 140mm line is designed, in general, for all-around performance, so it works great on heat sinks/rads, intakes and exhausts.3: Position invariable. Almost all fans use sleeve bearings, which in a typical position, where the bearing is perpendicular to the ground (think front case fans), are both quiet and long lasting. However, when placed parallel to the ground (think your power supply fan), they can become noisy and fail prematurely. The SSO2 bearings in the NF-A14 PWM are unaffected by position, making these great for fans that are mounted at the very top of your case or radiator.4: Long lasting. In large due to those superior bearings, these fans will last much, much longer than your computer will be relevant. You will easily get 4 or 5 entire computer builds out of reusing these fans, and given that fan technology doesn't advance at the rate that other computer technology does, you could conceivably reuse the same fans for 10 years or even longer.All in all, the NF-A14 PWM is my favorite fan within Noctua, including their higher speed iPPCs (which I also own) and their smaller fans.", "I bought two of these as an upgrade for the stock fans in the front a of Fractal Define R5 case. This is a 'silent' case so it is quite restrictive with few ventilation holes and it needs decent fans to push the air through.On the positive side the Noctuas come in a very nice box and with useful accessories such as the Y-splitter, low noise adaptors and vibration reduction mounts.  And they certainly shift a lot of air too - great if you have a restrictive case or need a radiator fan for water cooling.Unfortunately I find they do create a rather annoying low level humming sound around 550 to 700 RPM.  This means I am forced to run them at very low speeds.  Of course noise is subjective and the sound made not bother some people, but personally I was expecting a bit better from premium fans.", "I was skeptical at first due to past experiences. In fact, it can be that quiet when not running at full speed. After installing it, don't forget to fine-tune the speed in the BIOS. It runs half the speed and really quiet for me when the temp is about up to 70 degrees Celcius - my system never gets more than that anyway, unless I turn on the overclocked profile. Then it runs at a very high speed.I would recommend it to anyone building a new system. The color is a matter of preference, I think they also have it in black/gray.Note that I gave the same review for the Noctua NF-F12 5V PWM as I used both as chassis fans."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Desktop-Widescreen-Calling-Recording/dp/B004FHO5Y6/ref=lp_16225007011_1_272/135-9577034-5803252?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605593794&amp;sr=1-272#customerReviews</link><review> \ 'Why spend $50-75 for a webcam? This $19 option gives you EVERYTHING you ever wanted for crisp web conferencing, Skype, etc. It operates flawlessly with clear well-focused video, sits comfortably atop my 24" display, is infinitely adjustable, and the included mic sounds clean and clear.  Do yourself a favor and buy this inexpensive 720P webcam, and save your dough for where the highest resolutions really matter; such as a nice camera or smartphone upgrade.</review><review> "This webcam is better than I expected it to be. I was initially drawn to the price, and the fact that it can just rest over a monitor.PROS:- This cam takes a really nice picture and records or streams crisp, and without blur or distortion. It worked better than my laptops built in cam.- I can place it on my secondary laptop, or in a different area of my desk, to get multiple angles while recording or streaming.- Nice and portable-sized. Not big and bulky, heavy, or with the need to sit on the desk.- Sleek appearance. The webcam has a nice, rounded appearance that gives it a higher end feel.- I like that it accommodates a wide screen view and can capture in HD without problems.- I use this on my laptop and it rests on top. I'm able to slide it around until I get the preferred angle.CONS:- The only real con is that it doesn't clamp down too well. If I accidentally tug on the cord, the webcam easily falls off. I sometimes will let it set on the top of my laptop screen by the hinge (the part that bends) to make it a little harder to knock off. If it could have just a little more stability, it would be awesome.Overall however, I'm very happy with the purchase and really like this little cam.", "If you take online classes like I do where you are required an external webcam for proctoring, I highly recommend this device. It is the best quality product in the price range. Most proctoring programs require you to hold up an ID card up to the webcam to take a picture, and this webcam allows you to be able to do that while maintaining a crisp image.However, be warned: THIS VOIDS THE WARRANTY.You'll need to pop off the case (easily done without tools), and then remove three tiny screws holding the plate. When you have the inside exposed, you can see a tiny nub of glue that holds what looks like a gear surrounding the camera. I took a tiny flathead screwdriver to carefully remove the glue nub. Be very careful as doing this voids the warranty and it is very fragile. You can adjust the focus by rotating the gear clockwise or counter clockwise. Be very careful doing this as well--rotating the gear too far out may disassemble the camera lens.I have two cats, so I didn't want to risk leaving the covers off. I screwed the plates back on once I had the focus adjusted to where I would be able to take a close up picture of my ID clearly.", "We've come a long way from AT&amp;T's dream of picture phones or the massive equipment needed to video tele-conference.  Picture quality, light metering and focus are spot-on in auto.  But you can tweek picture elements to suit your taste.", 'The camera arrived on time, in good shape. If there is any issue, it is that the camera would not work on my Windows 10 Home Edition, unless or until I searched on Bing for the camera and found that I needed to download software and a firmware upgrade for the camera. The information was easy to find, and this is my secondary camera, so my only inconvenience was searching. I have two Windows machines and wanted the convenience of being able to video chat or Skype call from either. The software download was fast, self-installing, and usefulness was immediate, so the only caution I have is, "What if I was a complete newbie with peripherals for my computer, unfamiliar with downloading software? I would have been searching, in vain, for a disk of software in the same box in which the camera arrived."It all turned out fine.</review><review> "Let's face it: you're here because this is one of the cheapest webcam options. I'm not here to judge... we all just need to be on the same page here. I've rated this camera 5-stars not because it'll give you a crystal clear 4k image with a fantastic/responsive auto-focus and good depth-of-field. No. You'll get a 720p, everything-in-focus, not-so-great-in-the-dark webcam. It's not perfect, but if you're used to the webcam built into your laptop, this will be comparable... maybe even slightly better.If I had to list my biggest gripe is that there is no physical privacy shield for when the camera is not in use, but this does exist on some of the more expensive models. However, this camera can be articulated upward when not in use, so all hackers will see is your ceiling.TL:DR - It's cheap and it works.", "It's a good camera for skyping with but not good to record with. The 720p widescreen is correct for the video camera functions however it doesn't look great when you watch the recording back and even less so when uploaded to youtube. Having a light on the camera is great and it works well to remind you if it's on and it's easy enough to sit on your monitor though it may not work great on a thin screened laptop.Overall it's not great if you want it for anything other than skyping, if you want to record footage for youtube,etc I would just recommend getting an actual camera to mount to a tripod instead.", "My last webcam for my PC wasn't too great very grainy and very poor vision.This webcam HD fantastic very clear tracks your face.

Anyway, I found this razor to be adequate but definitely not great. After a day or two in the shower it got slimy feeling and felt gross to shave with. Didn't leave my legs any softer than shave gel which isn't slimy.

I love most of gillettes products, and I just have to say this is not one of my favorites.</review><review> "I like the fact that it has the pre-gelled part, however the soap on the razor itself does not last very long. This is probably one of my favorite type of razors though because you can switch out the blade part and continue to use the handle part. I don't think this razor is a cheaper than the disposable ones, but it makes my legs feel smoother. The blade lasts for about a week for me, but it could last up to a week and a half. I wouldn't recommend it any longer than that since blades do dull. The blade does last longer than the soap that is attached to it, so if you are still going to continue using it after the soap runs out then I would suggest you use some shower gel or something to go along with the razor. Also, if your skin is sensitive to scented soap then this probably would not be the best type of razor to use. Since, the pre-gelled part is Spa breeze scented. The package comes with a bath tub suction cup to hold the razor in place.", "Comfortable handle, not too heavy, and protects against accidental cuts.

I tried the JARBO brand based on customer reviews that they did work with Epson.

Since these run less than half the cost of Epson (probably even less since the color cartridges are filled to XL level) this is a spectacular value.</review><review> "Let me start by saying I really like Jarbo as a company. They're customer service is very responsive and if something isn't right they're always willing to work with you.Secondly, this is my second time buying re-manufactured ink cartridges.

I'm not getting any streaking, and it all looks very crisp and clear.The packaging it came in was super cute as well, most companies just wrap the cartridges in plastic and ship it out like that, but Jarbo has their own little box, like if you picked it up at the store. It was a nice little touch.", "Full Disclosure: I was given a $3 credit for this review.  Everything written below is my honest opinion of the product.I have an Epson WF-3640 and have been using remanufactured cartridges from day 1.  I've always had the best success with the Jarbo cartridges.  Unfortunately it's hit or miss if they have cartridges available for my printer.  When they are in stock I buy them.  I gave the overall value 4 stars because they used to provide over sized black cartridges, now they provide the small ones.  If you looking for cartridges that print great, and don't clog, these are the cartridges to buy.", "Good order fulfillment. I'm surprised how fast the black cartridge is using ink. Unfortunately I needed to realign my heads many times after installing all colors. Perhaps that is why the black usage is so high. I haven't decided yet if this is a good value compared to buying Epson. Why isn't black matched with an XL cartridge like the colors (Y-M-C)?On a positive note, when printing all colors come out clean &amp; crisp.As a follow up to my initial review, I am very impressed with the customer service. After reading my initial review, JARBO quickly reached out to me to resolve my problem. I've been using these cartridges for 2 months and they are performing better than Epson cartridges. After initial cartridge realignment (as mentioned above), the printing is still very crisp. Final feedback is that JARBO is a good value compared to buying Epson.Customer Service Exceeds Expectations !!!", 'Not happy. This ink the color was supposed to last up to 1100 pages.

It has included the receiver, 1/4 inch cable, 2 mics, 2 windscreens, to anti roll and drop slip on things, and the antenna were already attached to the receiver so you dont need to dig them out of the box and attach yourself. It was very easy to set up and was literally as easy as a plug and play microphone. I just hooked it up to my audio interface and plugged in the power and added batteries. Lets go into some pros and cons.PROS:1. Build quality - Everything in this is build solid and out of metal and I love that. The knobs are metal and turn smoothly, the receiver is metal, the mics are all metal, its great.2. Range - I tested by walking outside of an office building, through 4 walls, with 2 wireless routers and 10 cell phones in between and everything stayed recording nicely for the 60-80 feet I was away from the receiver.3. Stability - During the test I did above it had a clear recording whole time with no stability issues, no pops, no volume drops, no static. It sounded good and clear.4. Lots of stuff in the box - It came with everything that I would hope to add to a mic set like this in double because of two mics. Im so glad it came with windscreens already.5. LCD displays - Clear displays with easy enough to read stats, tells you all the needed info and the mics even tell you the battery level which I thought was pretty cool.CONS:1. Very deep tone - Not really a con since the sound is exactly what some people are looking for. It has a slightly excessive low tone that sounds a little boomy if you have a deep voice. You can hear it in the video. It does sound considerably smooth at the same time though.2. Batteries - No batteries included, just thought I would let you know somewhere in this review.FINAL THOUGHTS:Would I recommend this? Yeah I would, it was a good mic set that would probably be best used for interviews, podcasts, youtube, preaching on a stage, and singing in a higher vocal range.</review><review> 'My friend is a professional MC and DJ, and I have photographed weddings during my prior career. There are two brands that consistently are recommended by my vendor contacts: namely, Sennheiser or Shure. However, not everyone can afford the more pricey microphones, and recently, I asked my friend which product he would recommend to someone starting out with MC\'ing at weddings. He pointed me to this Tonor-branded set.First, UHF microphones provide more distance and more available frequencies for use at the venue, minimizing the possibility of interference from other signals. As such, he does not recommend VHF ones. So, how does this set of microphones fare? I asked him before purchasing a set for myself.PROS- Inexpensive alternative to the Sennheiser/Shure brands- UHF operation for greater distance and number of frequencies- Clear sound with no interference- Decent battery life for half the day. Uses AA- Batteries are replaceable, which is extremely important during important events: always have extra, recharged batteries available to swap with- Windscreens included- Easy to set up- Sturdy material and professional look and feel- LCD screen to show you a variety of information (Frequency, channel, battery level)- 2 year warranty- Expandable to 15 microphonesCONS- Manual could use some work- Not Bluetooth capable, and as such, cannot be used with mobile devices or laptops- No mute button. You\'ll have to power off/on for privacyTIPS- Long-press the power button to turn on/off- Double-press the power button to change channels. Be sure to set the other microphone to the same channel too- To use with a karaoke machine, check if it has a 6.35mm audio jackOverall, this is a great microphone for DJs, MCs, and Karaoke singers.

Because it is PD capable, it charges the Switch appropriately at 15V.The extra Type A port comes in handy as well for charging non-PD devices.I've also charged a couple Chomebooks at the same time with this charger.  The type C port correctly negotiates PD with a Lenovo Chrombook and fast charges it. I also plugged in another Chromebook simultaneously with a Type A to Type C cable and that charged fine as well, albeit slower. One thing to note is that with both Chromebooks charging at the same time, the charger got quite hot. You can touch it, but you probably wouldn't have to leave you fingers on it for more than a 5 seconds. I figure the Chromebooks were pulling somewhere around 50-55W total. I guess this is where the GaN technology might have helped and made me second guess my choice of buying a charger that's not GaN.Overall I'm very pleased with the charger considering it's not GaN.", "I have two laptops that use USB-C for its charging.But both of them use more than 90W from its original charger, so I wasn't quite sure whether it would still be able to charge them. Both of my Thinkpad and MacBook do get powered up properly and charges its battery while using them, so perfectly fine for me.", 'S20 Ultra device: does not do super-fast charging, despite it being 60W, 3.0 PD. You could get half a dozen smaller chargers that charge just as fast (if you don\'t already have that many).Would have given 1 star but to their credit, it does say "fast-charging" not super-fast-charging in the title.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HLL3270CDW-Color-Wireless-Printer/dp/B07KGVTMHJ/ref=lp_16225009011_1_2232/140-5547697-9211224?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605591104&amp;sr=1-2232</link><review> \ "In short, if you're buying to print documents, then this is a fair buy.Text and black and white images print incredibly sharp with great contrast. Fastest printer I've ever owned as well.However if you're buying this model specifically, it's likely you are doing so for the color support. If that's the case you might want to look elsewhere.I have a Cannon inkjet printer (MX922, which is a great inkjet by the way) but I needed a laser printer so I could print on semi gloss without visible smearing. In that respect this printer did its job; But the color production is faded at best, and blown out at worst.The color mixing is way off to add to this frustration. When set to grayscale, grays come out with a noticable red tint. Even after fiddling with the color settings the picture was still off-color.Again, if you're not concerned with color prints- this isn't a bad buy. If you don't want color, this isn't exactly the cheapest laser printer anyway.", 'I procrastinated a lot while trying to buy a printer. Every time I found a model I thought was "the one" I changed my mind after reading negative reviews. It always seemed to me it would be impossible to find a decent printer, which blew my mind away (it\'s 2020!).Fortunately, this was not the case here.It is nicely built, it connected to my wifi very easily, I could add it to all my devices (win laptop, Android phone, iMac, iPhone). As of today, every single time I sent something to the printer it came out printed as expected. Prints fast, doesn\'t jam. No complaints.It is a laser printer, I use it to print documents, forms, etc. You can print pictures but don\'t expect photographic high end quality, this printer is not for that.Great value for the money!</review><review> "This is a very good office printer for the price. Print quality is good. You have to consider the price you pay though. This ain't no $2,000 office product so don't expect professional printer quality output. For day-to-day and hobby use though, I couldn't be happier.A big advantage of this printer is that you can get quality generic high yield toner for really cheap (i.e. $99 for CMYK!).Regarding photo printing... it will print photo, but again, don't expect professional photo printing output.The bid disadvantage is (and this might just be the same for any color laser printer) you might need to spend1/3 of the toners that come with it just to set it up and tweak the setting for good results, which leads me to the second big disadvantage, unless you print basic B&amp;W text or simple graphics, you will need to fiddle around in the setting for quite some time before finding the right ones. Then printing will be very nice, but don't expect to print awesome material right out of the box.You have to know what you're doing and understand what each settings in the drivers and on the device itself does and what it means.For $246, I couldn't be happier with it!Last note... USE QUALITY PAPER!!!! You will never be satisfied with color printing on dirt cheap thin paper. Get quality high gloss laser paper!I recommend this printer only if you're willing to put the time and effort in tweaking it for best results!", "It did everything I expected it to and more. Some reviewers stated that it doesn't support two sided printing, however when I was printing a multi-page document and didn't uncheck the option to print to both sides of the page, to my surprise the page printed, pulled back in and printed on the opposite side.", "Super easy to setup and get running.  The printer is fast, even on duplex.  The first page does take a few seconds (particularly over wifi) but once it's going, it's page after page, and it's QUIET! (big bonus)Installing the toners and paper were a breeze.  I really liked that the machine asks what type of paper when you load the trays.The basic/standard colour output is acceptable but don't expect to be able to print photos (and you shouldn't be using it for that).Touch screen is fast and responsive.  I didn't install the computer app etc. so can't comment on that.", 'I\'ve had it for about 9 months now, since last September.  It\'s been working great.  I don\'t do a lot of printing but it\'s nice and reliable.  According to the info in the printer I\'ve printed out about 600 sheets so far.  I\'m still on the original print toner cartridges included.  The important thing for me, and the reason why I upgraded from an inkjet, is that with an LED or Laser printer you can keep the machine idle for weeks and months without worry about ink drying up.  So when you DO call on it to print, it\'ll snap into action and print reliably...the first time.  None of this "oh you have to clean the heads now and waste half the ink" just to get it working again like you do with inkjet.  I\'ll never buy another inkjet again.  This LED printer is fantastic, very reliable, with very high quality output, and economical too.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Charger-Cable-10FT-Compatible/dp/B08BRXMRJY/ref=lp_16225009011_1_7770_cpbg/146-3259335-6620207?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605593036&amp;sr=1-7770</link><review> \ 'This is a great deal for the set.

I can charge my phone while sitting on dining table and the wall outlet is on on the other end of the table. The cable themselves are very well built. The charging head has a very nice and study braided casing making it sturdy in long run with all the flex that head encounters in regular use. I am sure these cables are long lasting. Needless to say, it charges devices flawlessly.

I updated my wired mouse at the office with another version of this mouse and loved it so much I had to buy one for home. This version however doesn't have that great of a battery life. The other one turns itself off after about 15 minutes of inactivity. This one never turns off (at least when the computer is just asleep). I went through my first battery pretty quick, which was disappointing.The work version is still on the same battery and every co-worker who tries to use my computer and sees that the mouse won't move is frustrated, which is a huge bonus for me. All you have to do is click the mouse and it comes back. Just shaking it around does nothing though. The first time the screen goes black when the computer sleeps (when you would normally shake the mouse to wake it up) is pretty confusing and hilarious. Pretty quick you get used to clicking the mouse, then shaking the mouse, and then the computer wakes up. If you're not too comfortable with computers and don't care much about battery life, make sure you get the version that doesn't go inactive after a few minutes.I have very small hands, so this mouse is a bit too big for me, but should be fine for average hands. The previous and next buttons on the side are really useful and I don't accidentally click them because of the curvature of the mouse. I like that this one is more contoured to fit than the other one I got from them, which is more basic looking.The scroll wheel is sturdy and with a bit of rubber so your hands don't slip when scrolling like some of the other brand's plastic wheels. Adjusting the mouse speed is very easy with a click of a button so you can cater it to what program you're using (such as gaming, drawing something, just using a word document, etc.). Other mice you have to go into the operating system to adjust that. One really cool thing about this mouse compared to other brands is that the USB receiver stores inside the mouse. If you need to travel with it, you'll never lose the USB.In all, this mouse was definitely thought out and is incredibly cheap. It's much better than most of the mice you come across in the store.", "Excellent mouse to keep as standby if something happens to your favourite mouse during corona lockdown and you can't run out to buy one. Advantages:1. Smooth and silent buttons.2. Very precise cursor.3. Buttons for adjusting speed from the mouse itself.4. Lightweight.Disadvantages1. Not the best mouse for gaming since the design does not allow quick lifting off when needed.2. Needs 2 nos. AAA size batteries. Do not know how long they will last, yet.

This mouse if of normal size (bigger than Logitech M235) and should be perfect for all. Build quality is nice.

They work perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy Note9 (almost like they were made for them! :D ). The touch interface is seamless and intuitive. As soon as I remove them from their case/charger, they connect to my phone. Replace them in the case and they disconnect.They fit perfectly, an afternoon of constant use exercising, sitting by the pool, and doing "stuff", does not cause any discomfort. It\'s easy to forget one is wearing them.When I put them on Noise Canceling mode, 90% or the ambient noise is blocked. Turn that off, and the 3 mics pick up outside sound without seriously reducing the music quality.  I can easily pause the music and carry on a conversation, they also allow me to hear traffic noises when riding or running (important not to have the music too loud of course).I have not tested the batter life completely.  I\'ve had 2-3 hours of continuous music and 3-4 hours of standby/light phone use, and they still had 50% charge according to the phone app.  The case will fully recharge them about 1.5-2 times - estimated based on my use so far.  Suffice it to say that with the buds and case fully charged one could easily expect 5-7 hours of music and similar standby/phone use.  One can also just use the right ear bud for phone use, and leave the left bud in the case.

Even the bone at the outside corner of my hand gets sore from being pressured from the top of my desk. After speaking with some others with similar issues I decided to give this mouse pad a try. I figured that it is a heck of a lot cheaper than if I keep ignoring the problem and end up seeing medical help. I was hopeful, yet a bit skeptical, but after two weeks my wrist is no longer sore - even after a full day of work.

Very disappointing to say the least.", 'Call of Duty Modern Warfare launched yesterday, and I played 6hrs of it and this card was able to upscale from 1080p to 4K (using the 200% resolution slider) without any problem.  Game ran super smooth with my new Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, and 32GB of (yeah, overkill) ram.The card is fantastic in the acoustics department, it hardly makes any sound and my PC isn\'t even installed in the case yet, it\'s just sitting on a table all laying around.  At the end of the day, I was like you, wondering if I should get the less expensive Sapphire Pulse, and save $50...  But then a few days ago I was like, you know what - I\'ve been looking at these cards every day for a month, I\'m just gonna TREAT MYSELF and get the one with the best cooling so it lasts the longest, and has some resale value 5yrs from now.For those of you still reading, the two least expensive cards with the best cooling &amp; thermals are the Sapphire Pulse for $410, and the GIGABYTE Gaming OC $420.  The two most expensive cards with the best cooling &amp; thermals are this card $460, and the PowerColor Red Dragon $440.  ...Any of these 4 cards are going to be the cream of the crop, and honestly I wouldn\'t recommend the rest of the partner cards - as these 4 options have no faults whatsoever.PROS:+ Uses a reasonable 222W under load, whereas the stock AMD 5700 XT uses 186W+ Fan speeds are 1,400RPM under load, whereas the stock "blower" card (with just 1 fan) runs at 2,100RPM+ Due to the low fan RPM, the fan noise under load is just 43dBA, versus 52dBA for the stock card+ Thanks to the 3 fan design, the temperature of the card maxes out at just 71C, VS 84C for the stock cardNote: fan/temp stats were tested by our Australian friends over at Hardware Unboxed in their YouTube video entitled: "Sapphire RX 5700 XT Nitro+, Another Top Notch 5700 XT"CONS:- I\'m experiencing minor audio issues with some video playback, but I haven\'t used DDU to clean install my drivers recentlyConclusion:I recommend this card to everyone, and if you don\'t want to pay the ~$50 premium for this amount of cooling quality and low operating volumes, you can absolutely get either the GIGABYTE Gaming OC, or the Sapphire Pulse card and still have fantastic cooling and fan volumes.</review><review> "A massive upgrade over my GTX 970.

Make sure you have room. As of right now this is the coolest running and the fastest running 5700xt variant that money can buy. Just watch some youtube videos on it. This is the first Sapphire product I have owned and am beyond satisfied. Very high quality construction and looks. Of course Amazon is awesome as usual. Bought it on September 30th and it was back ordered and I was supposed to receive it October 13th. It arrived October 3rd. If your in the market for a higher end gpu buy it and don't look back.", 'I have this in a PC running a Ryzen 5 3600 with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO Black Edition, 2x8 GB 3200 MHz RAM, 1TB WD SN550 SSD, X570 Aorus Pro Wifi, Corsair RM650x PSU, and a Phanteks P600s case.I originally looked at a 2070 Super as the card to go with however, after checking reviews and benchmarks I changed my decision to this card. While the 2070 Super does perform better than this card, the performance increase is minimal when you factor in the cost that a 2070 Super comes at. You&#8217;re looking at a $100+ increase for minimal improvements that you most likely will not notice in most situations.The bad:The drivers and software support SUCK. Sapphire has done a decent job with TRIXX but AMD is really dropping the ball with so many issues here. This card has been out for awhile now, so AMD is aware of so many of the issues. My personal experience has yet to see a crash during heavy load but prior to a plethora of troubleshooting, I was experiencing BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) pretty much every day in mundane tasks. I could be browsing on Chrome, listening to music on Spotify, or watching YouTube videos and the computer would just randomly crash. Updating BIOS, removing drivers and reinstalling drivers, fresh install of Windows, trying AMD drivers from months ago, all did NOT fix the issue. This has ultimately hampered my experience as having an unstable system is unacceptable. Memory tests showed that the RAM was fine, and I even rebuilt the system to see if it would fix the issue. I also tried reseating the GPU to see if the connections were bad and the BSODs continued to happen. Finally, after weeks of troubleshooting, I am now running a decently stable system. After some help from a user on Reddit, I learned that the GPU does not like Window&#8217;s low power state modes for some reason. Disabling sleep mode, hibernate, and moving the system power to performance really helped my system become more stable. Keeping &#8220;Link state power management&#8221; at OFF under high-performance power plan has led to my system becoming much more stable and I have yet to experience a BSOD since (it has only been two days however). The card has been the source of headaches and countless hours of frustration and troubleshooting and AMD Radeon Software has been so unstable and has seriously hampered my experience. I guess the premium you pay for an RTX card is shown here. That being said, if you can be patient with your system and troubleshoot, its definitely worth exploring. AMD&#8217;s most recent drivers have addressed a lot of the other issues that users were experiencing with this GPU being extremely unstable, but I was experiencing a ton of issues with new drivers (as are other users). I would say that buying this card has taught me a lot about the world of enthusiast PC building but if I am willing to bet that if the country was not under lock down, I would have been willing to return this card and look to an RTX to forego the entire experience I wrote about above. Of course, AMD is trending in the right direction with driver support but it just feels like there is no end for this GPU (given that it has been out for months and AMD has continued to attempt to address these issues with no success - see driver updates where they mention that "Some users may still experience black screen or system hang issues during extended periods of gameplay. AMD will continue to monitor and investigate reports of these issues closely").Other than that, the GPU comes stock and will run hot so look to disable the silent fan mode. The card only allows you to set a minimum fan speed of 26% but even at this speed, the fan is relatively quiet, idle at 30-35 degrees C. It runs a bit hot if you keep it at load and the GPU does hover around 50-55 degrees C at idle. These temperatures are dependent on your case and fan setup so keep this in mind.The good:This card looks amazing. The RGB lighting looks amazing on the card and the backplate is solid. Sapphire TRIXX was easy to use to control RGB patterns. Under load, this card is relatively quiet even with the Phanteks panels opened. At stock, the fan curve has a mode that enables the fans to go into silent mode when the GPU is not under heavy loads, but I suggest changing this to a custom curve and disabling the silent mode. Doing so will result in better thermals and a happy GPU.This card hits the checkboxes for 1080p gaming and 1440p gaming. In AAA titles, the GPU really shines, and AMD has really flexed the work they have done in the past few years with this GPU&#8217;s performance and it shows with this card.While the card performs great, I gave it a two-star because the entire experiencing of troubleshooting the card really sucked. As a first time builder, if someone asked me about this card, I would definitely caution someone before they make this purchase. The learning experience was great for me but if you do not have the time or patience to spend on this card, I would really suggest to spend the extra premium on an RTX card. Furthermore, AMD\'s driver support is still struggling to address the BSOD and black screen issues as per the 20.4.2 notes for AMD Adrenalin. They are trending in the right direction but the fact that I was still experiencing issues on 20.4.2 without tweaking some Windows 10 options means that the issues are still there. Why do I need to disable features built into Windows 10 OS in order to maintain the stability of my system? These features are supposed to work together without the trouble I went through. These questions are basically the source of my frustration and without the work of some handy users on Reddit, I would not have reached a point where I could rate this card higher than 1 star.</review><review> 'De parte del vendedor no tengo nada que reprochar, llego bien, muy bien empaquetada, ya que pedi el embalaje Amazon para darle extra protection.Ahora la tarjeta funciona excelente, el unico problema que tuve fue al instalarla que no queria funcionar, pero era por mi BIOS, algo facil de solucionar.

I will definitely buy another one for my pregnant cousin.In addition, the quality of the desk is really good. It is made of very sturdy material and very easy to put together. My son also finds it very useful for him to put his toys and books on it. Overall, I highly recommend this laptop desk.", "I totally love the way it was packaged. That's a sign of a good product. Everything was neat and clean. I've been using my desk for almost 2 months and so far so good. Before ordering this desk, I had bought a bamboo one, and it left a bunch of sawdust on my bed when I opened the box, so I had to return it right away.I'm sharing a bedroom, so I don't really have much space, and this is exactly my savior. I love everything from this desk: material, color, design,.... This is the first time I write a review for an item that I bought, and it makes to spend time learning how to write a review (I'm working on my essay and it's due next week - I'm in a rush for my deadline!)About durability, I'll update if there's anything happens, but I'm very happy that I bought this desk. I always make a lot of research before purchasing something, and this desk is worth it.", "As I can see, it's a elaborate table. The main reason for me to buy it is I don't want to put my laptop on my leg while using it in some situation, like lying on the sofa and bed. I like it design that can fix my laptop from sliding (as shown in picture). Also, the height and angle and be easily adjusted to deal with any circumstances.Of course, its low price is  also an attractive point.", 'I love it so far, comfy and keeps me cool by keeping the laptop off of me. I\'m a gamer and wanted something with plenty of room to drag the mouse back and forth smoothly and quickly to rotate in-game - more than I was getting with one of the lapdesks that rest on the legs. This lightweight table delivers a very comfortable experience, with ample room for mouse movement next to a 15" laptop. The table surface is smooth, doesn\'t catch on the mouse anywhere, and I get excellent tracking on its surface even without a mousepad. The table stands fit well inside of my recliner\'s chair arms with plenty of leg room. A great bonus is the table lifts the laptop up and off my legs, which provides a better viewing against eye strain and keeps my legs very cool during operation as my laptop tends to get hot. The front tabs do great for keeping the laptop from sliding off if I angle the table toward me. This is so much more comfortable for me than using a lapdesk that rests on the legs. It\'s also great for sitting on the floor. I highly recommend this for anyone who is going to be using a laptop for extended periods away from a desk.</review><review> "An inexpensive but high quality laptop stand. Really useful and versatile. It can be used over your lap in bed or on the sofa or on a surface to give you a higher base. The legs are adjustable so it can be raised in hight, it can be set at an angle or used flat. Once positioned it remains in place and is very sturdy, it also has clips and a rubber lip to prevent either the laptop or mouse slipping off. There's plenty of room for both a laptop and mouse and it makes working much more practice. It's ideal for anyone home working or just regular laptop uses. It's well made and easy to clean as well as set up, when not in use it folds flat and takes up very little space. Really pleased with this item and very much looking forward to working from my bed. Brilliant product."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/LifeAround2Angels-Moisturize-Handmade-Birthday-girlfriend/dp/B01MFGN8S5/ref=lp_16225006011_1_91/146-2674640-6673818?s=beauty-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594582&amp;sr=1-91#customerReviews</link><review> \ 'I have a bathtub addiction and am a 5-6 night a week bathtubber so when I say I&#8217;ve tried all the bath bombs amazon provides, I&#8217;m serious. I keep going back to these, not only because of the price but because they actually work well. They don&#8217;t have all those annoying glitters and the scent actually sticks to your skin and serves a hydration purpose. I can&#8217;t say enough how much I love these over the 10-12 other brands I&#8217;ve tried.</review><review> 'I purchased these bathbombs because I was looking for an alternative to LUSH. I\'m a school teacher, I need relaxation without the price tag of around $7 a bomb! I was very excited to see that these bombs are handmade in the United States. They also are made of ingredients that are familiar to me. I ordered with Prime so they arrived in two days, as promised. The packaging is very simple. The bombs were well protected during their journey. None of mine felt broken. I could smell them through the box! Very strong, yet awesome, scents. They have a small sticker with the names of each bomb on the individual wrappers. I tried "Fun on the Beach" first. My entire bathroom smells amazing! My water is a hot pink/purple color. The bomb took about 2 minutes to dissolve entirely. I am so excited to try them all! Please support this small business. &#10084;I have two things on my wish list from this small company.1. Could they be a little bigger? I\'m not sure how complicated it would be to change sizes, but I have a large tub and a bigger size would be even more epic.2. Would you include an explanation of what the flavors are and how they are scented? Some are pretty obvious, but some I\'m not sure what they are made of. It would just add another level of cool.Thank you!</review><review> 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  \xa0Love these bath bombs! One of the best purchases I&#8217;ve made on here. There&#8217;s such a great variety, and I love the scents and colors! And they make my skin feel soft while I&#8217;m soaking in the tub.Will definitely buy again!</review><review> 'Product arrived as promised.  The packaging was ok.My issue with this product is the feedback I got from my wife.  After her relaxing bath she had to spend 10 minutes scrubbing the bathtub out because of the color bomb.  She told me she would never use them again.</review><review> 'I LOVE bath bombs! I have always loved Basin bath bombs, and usually stock up when I am near a store. My husband always cringes because he knows I am going to drop a few hundred dollars every time I go in the store I have also tried Bath and Body works bath fizzies. They smell amazing, and they are good too, but they can also be expensive. I decided to try these bath bombs, the price is unbelievable for what you get. I figured if I didnt like them, it was a great deal for the price, and I planned on giving most of them as stocking stuffers anyway. Wow, was I surprised! They smelled AMAZING, my skin was so soft after my bath, and they didnt leave a ring in the tub! Basin bath bombs always left a ring. I have found my new bath bomb source and will be ordering many more of these I use one every night in my bath. I take a shower each morning but I have to have a quiet relaxing bath every night and these definitely surpassed and exceeded my expectations! Not to mention the seller even sent a follow up email to check on the packaging and make sure I was happy. Now that is customer service! Thank you for making such a wonderful product at such a great price! Plus I love that I am helping  small business!</review><review> 'This is my second (and for sure not the last one!) box of LifeAround2Angels Bath Bombs. The first one I got as a gift from my husband, who I know made a deep research if they are safe, natural and healthy (because I&#8217;m pregnant). So, like most women crave for some type of food while pregnant, I crave for those bath bombs. In addition to this I have a 10 year old daughter whodecided I should share with her as well, so right after I was running out of the first box I already ordered a second one. All of them smell gorgeous! It&#8217;s such a pleasure to relax in a bathtub using them and your body smells so nice afterwards. I highly recommended this company.</review><review> 'Finding good-quality bath bombs on Amazon has been more difficult than I expected. I bought a set at Christmas that was rated well by hundreds of reviewers. However, every one of the bath bombs smelled like old lady perfume from the 80s and left skin dry. When I dug deeper into the reviews, I noticed that many trusted reviewers actually gave very low ratings. I should have paid closer attention to this warning sign.I hunted around for quite some time before I decided on this set from Life Around 2 Angels. I was not disappointed!First off, these bath bombs actually smell like what their labels indicate they&#8217;re supposed to smell like. Strawberry Kiwi smells incredible, as do Mango Papaya, Melon Ball, and Black Raspberry Vanilla. I love nearly every fragrance in this set but I&#8217;m really drawn to those four in particular. I like that each bath bomb is individually wrapped with a label, making scent identification easy.We&#8217;ve now used the entire set and not one has left behind any dye or big mess to clean up. (I have found that certain LUSH bath bombs leave the tub in quite a slippery, messy state after bath time is over.) Even more importantly, these bath bombs have left our skin feeling silky and refreshed, not greasy, and without discolouration from the light dyes.If you&#8217;re planning to give this set as a gift, your recipient(s) will be completely wowed. It is packaged so beautifully. I rarely include photos with any of my reviews but this simple but pretty packaging is worth showing.It&#8217;s only March but this set just became my go-to Christmas gift for 2019. It will be so fun to give these sets away, knowing how much relaxation and enjoyment they&#8217;ll bring.Update April 2019: I&#8217;ve already purchased three more sets of these (one for us, two as gifts). The gift recipients loved them as much as I do!</review><review> 'Love these bath bombs. I&#8217;m always hesitant when it comes to ordering scented products online but these exceeded my expectations. Each individually wrapped perfect for gifting. I plan to put in my kids Easter baskets as a non-candy option.Added bonus no staining of the bathtub like some other reputable brands I have tried.'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Brother-Monochrome-HL-L6200DW-Networking-Replenishment/dp/B01824JTWK/ref=lp_16225009011_1_2342/134-7422262-7801216?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605591144&amp;sr=1-2342</link><review> \ 'Why one star for a printer that actually does a good job of printing almost one copy per second?  Because when the "toner low" message appears, you MUST install a new cartridge on this model,  even though the last copy you printed looks perfectly black.  Brother printers used to have a "toner continue" mode that you could use when "low toner" appeared (and apparently many of their models still do).  They simply said that in that mode the quality of the printing would decrease the longer you continued, which makes sense.  However, as many others have noted, there is often enough toner in a "low toner" cartridge to print hundreds more pages of perfectly acceptable quality.  And maybe what I\'m printing doesn\'t have to be "top quality" and I would just like to get it printed!  With this model, Brother no longer offers the "toner continue mode" (as a Brother customer service rep apologetically informed me), forcing you to stop in the middle of print job, and waste time and money installing a new cartridge.  I\'m very unhappy with this!</review><review> "I bought this for my home office a few months ago. Out of the box, it was great - easy to set up, straightforward to use, prints quickly and clearly. I bought the high capacity toner so I could get more life out of it. Now, at 10pm on the night before I have to go to court, the printer decided it's out of toner and STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY. Never mind that it was printing perfectly fine, and never mind that I haven't even printed two packs' worth of paper yet. It insists it's out of toner, and nothing I can do (resetting the drum counter, covering the sensor, trying any of the other hacks online) will change its mind. This is a waste of money and resources, and a huge hassle. Brother has gotten too greedy. Making the printer useless until you feed it more toner isn't the way to win over customers.Update: I purchased the high yield toner. It's 6:15am, and I'm printing some last minute documents for an important presentation this morning. Guess what - the printer has decided it's low on toner, so it will stop any minute. I'm just hoping I can get through the documents I need before it quits working. I would 100% prefer to have lower quality documents rather than NO documents. Looks like I'll be scrambling to print at FedEx or something.", "This is an excellent printer. Really basic ultra fast black only printer. It's FAST to print full duplex.  The wifi wired setup also is zero fuss and just works straight outta box as a wired Ethernet printer .  You can setup wifi fast and no fuss too but if you have the option , then just connect it to Ethernet.The paper feeder holds a crazy huge wad of paper too. Fewer paper refilling.Android connectivity is fully reliable and I've not had any issues either.Best part of this all is the price tag.  I sctual managed to find this as a open box Amazon warehouse deal 200$. Comes with a starter kit toner which should actually last a very long time.  But that isn't all. There are a few low cost third party toner cartridges that cost significantly lower than OEM brand and I tried one which prints exceotially crisp. I cannot tell the difference.  So that means the cost of ownership is extremely budget freindly low !!! Search for LCL Compatible for Brother TN-880. 60$ for TWO High yield toner kits.My previous printer had toner that costs more than the printer itself so I just threw it out and bought this instead.I highly recommend this no fuss no gimmick printer that does one job and one job well. Print .", 'Typical Brother Printer. This was an upgrade from HL-L5200DW.  Paper tray takes a full ream of paper. Only difference is there is a longer delay before it starts printing.  Once it starts though it produces much more pages per minute.  There is also a super high yield toner available for this new model HL-L6200DW then was available with the previous model. Overall good machine. I am partial to Brother machines.</review><review> 'Bought 5 of these all told, Solid printer, love the capacity-whole ream at a time (550 sheet).

A 180-gram recording. No problems with this format. So I am not sure what is going on with the other comments.I have this exact album (Miles) on CD, I was noticing things I NEVER heard on the CD. I forgot how beautiful LP records sound. This was a birthday present to myself. I thought it was cool and retro. I gave away my LP's when CD's came out. I hate skips, pops, and noise. I think I may have been premature in doing so. I think there is a definite tradeoff --convenience versus fidelity. This LP sounds like getting into a warm bathtub feels. Just relaxing and well... immersive!I also think there are diminishing returns for turntables. This turntable sounds amazing! I can't imagine paying two to tens times more and getting two to ten times better sound!I paired this with the Micca RB42's and a cheap amplifier (You need an amplifier or powered speakers!) OMG, this sounds like I spent thousands of dollars for a high-end stereo system! Get the Micca RB42's if you can, they keep selling out!*** Ok, it started skipping on the first track of even new albums. Looked at forums, the number one thing to do with this turntable is to level it, got out my level, found I was off by a fraction. One and a half turns of one record stand leg and it stopped skipping. YOU MUST LEVEL YOUR DECK!**** Update, still skipping on the first track of every LP! New or old. I can see why you need a better turntable. No skip control. It is almost like the tone arm has a fault after the first minute of the first track. All other tracks on my new LP's don't skip. The first one minute of the tracks are just fine, then a SKIP! on three different LP's so far. Sending back, and getting a higher end turntable... so disappointed!

It has things the other cheap record players don&#8217;t&#8212;such as a counterweight. It players all my records flawlessly (minus any damage from the other record player) and it sounds great.

Hold to turn it on, short tap for brightness level (on the white), long tap for changing to color mode, and short tap on color mode to go through the colors.

A small laptop or a tablet fit well, but with a 17 inches PC, the cup holder would probably be under the computer and not useable (not sure, to be verified).- I miss the wrists support that I had with my previous laptop desk. A 1 inch thick cushion in front of the keyboard would allow the wrists to rest in an ergonomic position during long typing seances.- The lamp beam is a little narrow from my point of view. It's not a problem with a computer, because I angle it sideway so the beam is nearly parallel to the keyboard surface, which provide enough light to type. But if used to read a book, you end up with a 5 inches bright spot in the middle of the page. The bright spot is a little too bright, and the surrounding is a little too dark for my taste. (I suspect that I could play with the lamp angle and find a setting that reduce this inconvenient).", "I am happy with this laptop desk as it does what it needs to and it's comfortable to use.  My main use for this right now is for adult colouring because I can now colour on my lap rather then sitting at a table. The light is okay to use but I would have liked to have a brighter light and I find that sometimes the light falls over onto my paper. I also like the soft material that is underneath the product; I think it adds to the comfort of the lap desk.  Overall, I am happy with the product and, despite my light issue, I would recommend this item to anyone."</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-Toughpower-256-Color-Warranty-PS-TPG-0850FPCGUS-R/dp/B01MQU6CWU/ref=lp_16225007011_1_2371/146-1573669-1159910?s=computers-intl-ship&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605594524&amp;sr=1-2371</link><review> \ "Ended up having to use an old power supply after this one fried parts of my gaming system.  it took out my liquid cooler that took a long ass time to build.I liked you guys a lot.

After a few days of uptime, I started having spontaneous restarts, which I determined to be power related.  I contacted CyberPower and we determined the PSU was overly sensitive to the switchover to battery time. I returned the UPS and tried a APC BR1000MS Sine Wave UPS.  Same problem.  APC tech support bent over backward, sent me a new UPS, but the results were the same.  I contacted Thermaltake, and their response was "that power supply needs a sine wave UPS"  I let them know about the previous conversations with CyberPower and APC and their reply was pretty much "Oh well".  So, I bought a Seasonic FOCUS Plus 550 Gold SSR-550FX 550W 80+ Gold from Amazon,  and it works flawlessly.The Thermaltake Toughpower Grand RGB 650W 80+ Gold is going back to Amazon.

Surfing, gaming, VR, Virtual Pinball, etc. One morning, I turned on my PC and nothing happened, no power. This is a scary feeling!!! So the first thing I did was swap the battery on my motherboard hoping this may be a quick fix. No dice. I was fairly certain that my old 800 watt power supply failed so I searched for a replacement. I'm really pleased that I stumbled onto this particular unit - they were selling a similar one at Best Buy for the same price, but it only had Bronze certification, not Gold. So I purchased this unit, swapped the power supplies, held my breath, powered on, and thank god -- it worked!! This power supply is so much better than my older one -- LOVE the RGB colours and the modular design. I only installed the wiring that I needed rather than having to tie off / bind loose cables like I did with my older power supply.

I purchased these two months ago, wanting to fully evaluate them to see how they would hold up as solar light batteries and various other uses. First thing I did was charge them. Each battery was precharged as promised, took about 30 to 90 minutes before indicating a full charge. I had about 16 solar lights of varying models.I purchased a smart charger in order to charge them individually since these would be discharged in the same manner.  This turned out to be a very smart investment, more on that later.  As I started using them, swapping out the original batteries, I found all my solar lights had very cheap cells, varying anywhere from 300 to 900 mAh.  This explains why a lot of them were seldom on more than a few hours, if at all.  The older solar lights were worse off, there was battery leakage in half of them. I did some general cleaning and testing them, finding a few solar lights would stay on even in a dark room, or not turn on at all.  After some research the problem was not a battery problem, the photocell light sensor had gone bad.Through the first few nights of use I noticed some solar lights were not lasting very long just a few hours, while others stayed illuminated the entire night.  This is where the smart charger came in very handy.  I rotated some of the EBL batteries around and seeing their mAh charge capacity: most were getting the full 1100 mAh, a select few were charging only to 500 mAh.  So to troubleshoot the lower rating I discharged cycled and recharged at a higher 500 mAh charge.  This worked great, now getting the full 1100 mAh. What seemed to have caused this was memory effect of charging in certain solar lights (always seemed to be the same solar lights going out).I checked these periodically throughout the night for the first few weeks, and found they were much more stable. Now into the second month most of my solar lights stay illuminated all night, which is saying they last 10 hours this spring/summer, quite amazing. And I of course should say, they work best after a bright and sunny day. After a few rainy days they do dim after 5-6 hours, but the next sunny day fixes that.  My solar lights are always the last to dim compared to the neighbors, lol.Side note: I have used these in a flash light and an Xbox controller, both applications met my expectations.  I also purchased the higher capacity EBL NiMH batteries (white exterior) for those devices, all I can say is A+ for EBL.The EBL 1100 mAh NiCD batteries have been an exceptional purchase for me, hope this lengthy review helps some people. :)</review><review> 'What a steal!! I was going to replace all of my outdoor solar lights in my backyard that are on their last leg. Then I saw these and realized I&#8217;d be saving a ton of money by just replacing the batteries in them instead. Boy was I right!I took the advice of another reviewer and bought the battery charger as well. Within a couple hrs I had all 18 batteries completely charged and in my solar lights.I can&#8217;t attest to the life of the batteries quite yet, but I&#8217;m very pleased with them so far.If your like me, and needing new outdoor solar lights, don&#8217;t buy new ones! Get these batteries instead, as well as the charger and you&#8217;ll save a ton of money!'</review></item><item><link>https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Mini-90-Instant-Brown/dp/B00U6VUXV4/ref=lp_16225009011_1_5596/140-7564913-3818519?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1605592271&amp;sr=1-5596#customerReviews</link><review> \ "Really enjoy using this camera. I've had this camera for 4 months now but didn't use it much during the winter (because of the film's temperature range - winter too cold!). I recently went on a trip to Seattle and tested out the various modes. The colors come out pretty great and there's wonderful clarity on landscape mode. I love the somewhat grungy/vintage look that prints without using any of the modes as well. Super fun and great camera!P.S. When they say don't point the camera at the sun, really don't. I caught the sun in one of my photos and it was a beautiful black circle in the sky. Haha.", "I bought this camera on a whim. My girlfriend and I were headed to Iceland, and I was planning to propose. I wanted to capture all the little moments of our trip and make an album. This thing is an absolute blast. For those of you who remember polaroids, you'll fall in love all over again with the Instax. I opted for the mini 90 over the mini 9 primarily for style. The brown vinyl is perfectly vintage. I also found out later that this camera had more features (Although I rarely use the different modes). This camera is not designed to take crisp, brilliant pictures. Instead, it looks like it's been put through a vintage Instagram filter. There are so many things you can do with the pictures. I made an Engagement album, sent one as a post card, framed a few. If you search Etsy for instax albums and frames you will be pleasantly surprised at the versatility of these photos.As for the modes, the instructions do included do not provide the best info. There is party mode (man and woman icon) which brightens up indoor photos, Landscape mode (Mountain icon) which enhances distant photos, D&amp;L (Dark and light) which adjust brightness, macro mode for close shots, and a few others. But really, just grab the camera and get to shooting! It'll turn out just fine.", 'It worked for about 5 months, then after that it would not let me take any photos. It gives me an "E" where the photo counter normally is. I\'ve tried a \'reset\' by holding power and shutter button, I\'ve tried removing and recharging battery, I\'ve tried a new roll of film (which ejects the first cover correctly when I do that). Nothing is helping. I basically have a dud and no way to get it replaced since it\'s past the return date. I have heard others have this problem and have to get it returned or repaired.UPDATE: So I contacted Fuji Film\'s support department and they told me to ship the camera in with a description of the issue and a copy of the purchase order (Amazon order screen). They took about 2 weeks, shipped me a new one and gave me a replacement cartridge of film. If you encounter the E issue, and are within warranty (one year of purchase) you may be able to do the same thing. Still frustrating that this error seems to be fairly common though.</review><review> "It is a very nice camera but it isn't Canada-proof.

At first I was kind of weary about this but all products were new and packaged appropriately! I am super happy with my purchase.

It is a completely different experience using the headphones with or without these in my opinion Apple would easily double their sales of AirPods pros if they were to include these memory foam tips stock!

I literally wore these for 6 hours the other day cuz I forgot they were in and I was on transparency mode they&#8217;re soooo comfortable ! Annnnnd on top of that the customer service is absolutely unmatched ! I had a small shipping issue and they were able to not only fix the problem but correct it and make it even better without any hesitation at all on their part!10/10 I could not recommend this product enough , this is literally the best accessory you will ever buy for your AirPods Pro, ever!</review><review> 'I purchased these a few weeks after purchasing Apple;s AirPod Pros. I originally purchased the AirPod Pros because apparently I have really small ears and other in ear headphones tend to just fall out. With the AirPod Pros, they still fell out of my ears when using the included silicone ear caps.I decided to purchase these to see if there was a way to use my AirPod pros without them constantly falling out of my ears. So far, have been extremely satisfied with this product. I went from not being able to do even the simplest movements without the AirPods falling out of my ears to being able to run sprints, do burpees and other high movement activities. The memory foam works great, makes it so the AirPods stay in my ears and overall they are pretty comfortable, although the feeling of them did take a few days of getting used to. I do not see any difference in the sound quality with these over the included silicone ear caps, and all functions work just the same as before. I would highly, highly recommend these if you are having trouble with your AirPods falling out of your ears.The only thing I would change about this product would be the ability to purchase just one size. From already having AirPod pros, I knew what size I needed so paying the extra money to receive all three sizes isn&#8217;t the worst thing, but it would be nice not to have to do it.</review><review> "These are a bit more expensive than some of the other AirPods Pro foam tips that just appeared on the market, but after buying 3 different pair, these are definitely the best.  Few things stand out:  1) Higher quality foam -- it's still soft but has a tiny bit of grip, so it doesn't fall out of the ear.  2) Deeper tip -- again, this goes to fit.  These tips are slightly longer than other ones, so it's much easier to get a nice solid ear fit.  3) Good customer service!  Had a minor issue with one of the tips I received, and the seller sent out a replacement without any hesitation.  Get these!", 'These have actually made my airpods usable. My airpods used to fall out of my ear at the gym, with these foam tips they stay in and are more comfortable. They also still fit in the charging case properly.'</review></item></amazon_items>
