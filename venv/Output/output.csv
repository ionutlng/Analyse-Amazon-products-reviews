","['\n\n  The results are unbelievable, Was a bit skeptical because all the reviews were from Caucasian women. I was slightly worried that my skin would not respond as well but I was quite mistaken.With or without makeup, my skin is bright, smooth and my spots are disappearing.One other result i am sure a number of people have not noticed is that your palms get softer too, i guess the residue on the palms makes it soft and supple.\n\n', '\n\n  I wanted to love this, but unfortunately every time I put it on my face it would dry it out. I even put on moisturizer, but it would dry out my face so bad I would get dry spots on my cheeks and above my eyebrows. At first I was convinced it was due to the cold dry weather, but once I stopped using it took at least a week for my skin to get back to normal. I do not recommend this product.EDIT:Although the product did not work out for me, TruSkin provides wonderful customer service! Erica emailed me right away once she found out the product dried out my skin and offered a refund. She then recommended another product that might be better for my dry skin and is going to ship it to me free of charge. I was truly amazed by the quality of service and hope that the new product will work much better for me!\n\n', ""\n\n  Hello my fellow amazon-lovers. First I want to say that I never write reviews... but I am just TOO excited to not share my results with you. A little bit of a background first- I am 23 years old, a medical student, with very TIRED, acne-prone, and dull skin. I have struggled with acne throughout my entire adolescent and adult life. I have used many products all over the market--including Proactiv, Proactiv+, birth control, and nearly every drug store product you can think of. Some things will keep my acne at bay, but....the years of heavy chemicals trying to treat my acne has definitely hurt the integrity of my skin. I have had new fine lines, wrinkles, HEAVY bags, and dark circles. I started doing research on skin care and decided to completely re-vamp my beauty routine. If you care about your skin, you should not hesitate in purchasing this serum. To be very fair with you, I need to explain my daily routine--and ALL the products I use (some from amazon, some from the drugstore. but all reasonably affordable). My skin is still not perfect. I do have a few blemishes that will pop up, but as for my skin overall... it has helped tremendously. These are my TWO WEEK results using this serum. Yes. I said it... TWO WEEKS. I do plan on updating this in a few months. Now, I will list below my entire CURRENT routine. Once again, DON'T HESITATE.Morning:1.) Cleanse with Burt's Bees gel acne cleanser - Drugstore  ***Not my favorite, but it is gentle and it's not causing more breakouts. I will likely be switching this soon.2.) Tone with Simple Soothing toner - Drugstore  ***Nice, not irritating, I would recommend for those battling redness. I am thinking about trying new toners as well.3.) TruSkin Vitamin C Serum!!!! - Amazon  **** HOLY GRAIL. I use approximately the size of a dime in my hand. Allow to fully dry/absorb.4.) Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream with SPF 30 -Drugstore  **** I adore the texture of this. It's a perfect moisturizer and make-up primer. I would suggest it for all skin types.5.) Bae Body Eye Gel (Amazon)Makeup:I do not wear makeup every day. However, I have permanently switched to Neutrogena skin clearing foundation (drugstore). I apply with a new disposable makeup wedge each time. It is a medium coverage foundation, and it DOES NOT cause breakouts (at least for me).Night:1.) Cleanse with Burts Bees.2.) Tone with Simple.3.) First layer of TruSkin Vitamin C Serum.4.) Dermaroller!!!!!!  ****Ever heard of this? I was skeptical too. A dermaroller is a small roller that is covered with microneedles. You roll it on your skin to increase  collagen production and increase absorption of skincare products. The one I purchased was a 0.25 mm roller from the brand Sdara  (Amazon). There are many to buy and many to choose from. I would recommend reading reviews first before your purchase! I roll for 3-5  minutes all over my face. It does not cause any bleeding, however there will be some slight redness and it might burn. No worries, it should  be gone by morning.5.) Second layer of TruSkin Vitamin C Serum. Wait for it to be fully dry and absorbed. Your face will be tight, with slight tingling or burning.6.) TruSkin Retinol Moisturizer. (Amazon)7.) Bae Body Eye GelI do not promise that this will work for anyone, but it has helped me tremendously and in a very short time. I do believe though that consistency is KEY.I have not been in contact with ANY of the companies who's products I have reviewed. TruSkin has not given me a discount or anything for this review. I am just an honest girl hoping to spread the word on what has brightened me up. If you have any hesitation, Don't. Give it a try. I hope this helps someone.XOEDIT: The second photo is my 2 month results!!! My skin is more even, brighter, and I’m still seeing improvements. Thank you TruSkin!\n\n"", '\n\n  This product saved my skin. I did NOT receive this at a discount and this is NOT a sponsored review. I seldom write reviews but just had to review this product. I’ve been struggling with acne for YEARS. I have very acne-prone skin. I get a new pimple almost every day and it seemed like there was never a time I didn’t have a pimple on my face. Acne leaves super dark blemishes/scars on my face. I do believe my acne is partly genetic - another reason may be stress from college and not getting enough sleep. I’ve tried all different types of moisturizers and cleansers. Nothing worked. However I bought this serum on a whim. Omgggg. Guys. Literally my face stopped flaring within 3 days. I was PIMPLE FREE FOR MORE THAN 48 hours (a new record). In the photo, the left side was day 1 of applying serum. As you can see I had extremely dark blemishes and active pimples.  The photo to the right shows my skin exactly 2 months later. Blemishes have faded DRASTICALLY and I have no active breakouts. This hasn’t happened in years. I truly and honestly think it is due to this product. If you are hesitant, don’t be BUY IT!- I cleanse my face every morning and night with Burt’s Bees deep cleansing cream, then moisturizer and follow it with 3 drops of this serum (one drop for each cheek + chin and one drop for my forehead).It has also helped my under eye bags (use one drop for both undereyes; pat gently with fingers.)\n\n']"

","['\n\n  I actually bought this stuff to use as a face wash to help me with my acne. I\'ve tried every face wash imaginable and also tried prescription face stuff and nothing would get rid of my acne :/ I only get acne on my chin, it\'s not very severe but it is constant and annoying (and I believe hormone related). I read online that using dandruff shampoo with ""Ketaconazole"" as the active ingredient as a face wash was really effective at getting rid of acne. I was skeptical, as I said I\'ve tried everything from prescription creams, benzoyl peroxide, special face washes, natural products and oils and nothing seemed to work. This stuff surprisingly has cleared my face. I wash my face with this stuff in the morning and at night and let it sit for 1-2 minutes before washing off. Also, I moisturize with Vaseline on my face overnight (another acne relief miracle worker I read online--no it doesn\'t clog your pores). If you have acne I would suggest looking up this product and Vaseline uses as well, worked for me. Hopefully my routine continues to work. If it doesn\'t I will update!\n\n', '\n\n  So I have really curly hair and about a year ago I switched from head and shoulders to devacurl products but I noticed I started developing dandruff. I tried the home remedies but couldn’t stick with them because I didn’t feel like making the recipes. So I just said forget it and went on with my drandruff life for about a year. Until someone recently pointed out my dandruff and i was SUPER embarrassed. 10 minutes after, I went on amazon determined to finally get rid of this annoyance and I found this shampoo with really high reviews so I decided why not. After about 2-3 uses, my dandruff was literally gone!! Definitely wish I would’ve bought this sooner. So I use this shampoo and I still use my devacurl one condition and now I’m dandruff free. So if you’re on the fence, trust me just get it and try it.\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve had dandruff flare ups off and on my whole life.  I tried this product with hope.  It didn’t do anything as far as I could tell.So I researched the cause of dandruff recently and discovered there isn’t one cause, but many.  Some are from dry skin; others from anxiety; and still others from a kind of bacteria that lives just beneath the top layer of skin.So I experimented with a variety of DIY at home solutions; going around with a greasy cream substance on my head (and transferred to my pillow) at night.What worked best for me was using over the counter triple antibiotic cream. I now believe my dandruff to be the kind caused by that just-under-the-skin bacteria; whatever it is, and will report my findings to my doctor so maybe, once and for all, some specific antibacterial product will kill off these little nuisances that cause my dandruff flareups.Best of luck to all with dandruff issues.  I hope this product works for you, but if not, Google home remedies for dandruff, I’d still no luck try what I found works best:  triple antibiotic cream from the drug store.  If you notice any improvement, see your doctor and share your findings.\n\n', '\n\n  If I could give this product more than 5 stars then I would!! My husband has suffered from extreme dandruff/Psoriasis  for years to the point that he would pick constantly at his scalp. I would be able to visually see large sores and peeling skin chunks constantly no matter what shampoo/treatment he would use. This was of course a very frustrating thing for him to deal with as his favorite color to wear is black.... I found this product by chance and told my husband about it, who was willing to give it a chance (he’d more than given up on finding a solution to his problem at this point). After two shampoos he said that he absolutely noticed a difference and did not feel that he had to scratch his scalp. His sores healed within a week and now he has a clean, itch/flake free scalp! This stuff worked absolute wonders for us and I would recommend to anyone with slight dandruff issues to extreme Psoriasis conditions!\n\n', '\n\n  This stuff is absolutely amazing. I was one step away from going to the dermatologist. I had severe dandruff that  was so bad I could shake my head and it would come off. With just a few uses per week, I got rid of all of my flakes. My scalp also stopped burning from dryness. My hair has never been healthier. (I bought this product using my own money. I was not paid or given anything free for this review. This is important to me when reading reviews so I thought I would mention it.)\n\n', ""\n\n  I have had chronic dandruff since I was a child. I've tried lots and lots of over the counter products and they'd all seem to work for a few days, but it would never completely clear up and the product would eventually quit working altogether. Sometime over the years, I just gave up. I figured nothing could help and I never felt like making time to see a specialist doctor. After an extremely uncomfortable flare-up prompted me to see if there were any new products, I found Nizoral.After the first use, I was impressed. The dandruff was drastically reduced and my head had completely stopped itching. I've been using this product as directed for about three weeks now and I do NOT have dandruff or any itching at all. The shampoo smells nice too.My one criticism is that the shampoo does seem to be a but drying, so I will just start using a conditioner as needed. I am so excited to be free of flakes!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I'm SO excited. I have chronically suffered from scalp dermatitis and have PCOS, so the combination has cause my hair to thin dramatically over the past few years. I bought this shampoo as a last resort after trying Head and Shoulders, charcoal shampoos, biotin shampoos and scalp clarifying solutions. My scalp was noticeably clearer after 2 uses so I kept using it about 2-3 times a week. After almost a month I realized I have new hair growth all over my scalp! In the photo the little black spots are tiny hairs coming in.\n\n"", '\n\n  After doing some research on hair products to be proactive against hair loss, I kept coming across recommendations to use Revivogen Shampoo and then use Nizoral Shampoo once a week.After being on this cycle for about almost a year, I can confirm that it definitely has a positive impact. My hair is differently thicker and shinier, and my scalp is very clean.I wasn’t exactly going bald, but over the years, my hairline had receded somewhat. I can’t say for sure whether this has halted my receding hairline, but given the improvements to my hair and scalp, it’s worth the money.I had a hard time spending this kind of money on Shampoo. But a friend of mine swore by it, and now I understand where he was coming from. If you can afford it without breaking the bank, go for it\n\n', '\n\n  Shockingly effective. I used it for my hair but it also worked remarkably for my beard/moustache area...and in both cases it worked after the first application. Downside? It looks like an ugly medical product in your shower and people will judge you. Upside? It doesn’t smell bad like most of them.\n\n', ""\n\n  i have tried every product on the market and never had any success. The first day I used this product I noticed a difference. Being a skeptic I didn't get too excited. Well its been over 2 months now and I can honestly say this is the first and only product that has worked for me.  To say im happy and impressed is an understatement. Wish I had know about this before. An added bonus is this shampoo lathers up great and leaves my hair feeling great. thank you for this product !!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Love this stuff. I didn't have a whole ton of dandruff prior to using this but I had enough to make me self conscious. After even just one use I noticed an immediare difference in the amount of visble dandruff on my scalp and now its been around a month and my scalp is as clean as ever (one or two dandruff dots here and there but VERY minimal). I've also noted less scratching and scalp acne. Only downside is I don't really notice an improvement in hair fallage when I shower like it says in the benefits but better than an increase. Overall, I'd buy it again and recommend it to those looking to soothe their scalps and assist in eradicating dandruff.\n\n"", '\n\n  Wow, I can’t believe how itchy my scalp was last month. Lol. I’m so relived it’s better now!! Thanks to this stuff, I’ll definitely be buying this again. It took about 3-5 washes to notice a huge difference but even after the first wash I noticed a bit of a difference. But now after about a month, It’s totally cleared up.\n\n']"

","['\n\n  I was kind of hesitant at first because the texture is like lotion, but don’t let it fool you! It’s such a great face wash! I have struggled with my acne for years and have tried a billion different products and none of them worked like this one. It took about a month of consistent use but it made my skin look almost flawless. I’m not wearing makeup in either pictures.\n\n', ""\n\n  I don't know what I got from Amazon, but it is not CeraVe. I have been using this product for 6 years, and thought I'd save some money by ordering from Amazon instead of purchasing at my local Ulta.1. It smells different. 2. It burned like hell (CeraVe has NEVER burned my skin). 3. It left my face squeaky clean (CeraVe never dries out my skin). 4. The packaging does not match my last bottle, which I purchased from a local pharmacy. 5. The font on the Amazon bottle is different from the CeraVe logo, and is missing the trademark icon, which they put on EVERY instance where their name is used.\n\n"", '\n\n  I have dry, extremely sensitive skin. I bought this cleanser on a whim, and it’s the best one I’ve ever used! I’m shocked by all of the negative reviews.To be specific, this cleanser does not lather like soap. It reminds me a lot of how primer from Bare Minerals feels. It’s silky smooth! I use one pump, and rub it all over my face for about a minute. I’ve never had an issue with it not removing my makeup! I mean, waterproof mascara needs a little extra help coming off. But regular foundation, eye shadow, etc comes off just fine. I used to not be able to wash my face multiple times a day for fear of my skin drying out. Now I can wash my face as often as I want and I never dry out. I feel like this cleanser really does “restore the skin barrier”.Not every beauty product works for everyone. But I had to leave a positive review for this product I love so much! I look forward to washing my face now, and it’s helped me to stick to my skin care routine.\n\n', ""\n\n  The texture of this is like lotion, truthfully is fragrance free as advertised.  My problem is that it doesn't cleanse well.  After the first wash, I still visibly have makeup on my skin.  After the second, I still have makeup on a cotton pad with toner applied.  It takes three full washes to get all of the makeup off, and I am only wearing a light foundation with powder.\n\n"", '\n\n  I have been using this face wash for about a month now.  I wanted to wait to post a review to make sure my results weren\'t just a fluke thing.  I suffer from cystic acne.  I have since I was a teenager.  I am now in my early 30\'s.  I\'ll get normal pimples here and there, but I more commonly get deep cystic pimples that I could do absolutely nothing about besides wait (sometimes up to a month or two) for them to finally go away on their own.  I have tried too many products to count ranging from Proactiv to Differin to every over the counter face wash/cream/gel you can think of.  I tried changing my diet numerous times and cutting out certain foods that are known for causing acne flare ups.  I have tried everything.  I take Ortho Tri-Cyclen birth control pills since they are supposed to help with acne and also because birth control is supposed to help regulate hormones, and cystic acne is supposedly caused by imbalanced hormones.  I got this face wash on a whim.  I figured I\'ve tried every acne product out there and always end up with dry, flaky skin (but would still get at least one new break out per week on average).  I have read that acne can result from over drying of the skin - that your face produces excess oil to compensate for the drying facial products and the excess oil results in more clogged pores/acne.  To be honest, I never bought into that and continued trying a million acne products.  I finally broke down and purchased CeraVe Hydrating Face Wash - going in the complete opposite direction of all the products I\'ve used in the past.  I figured why not try it?  My skin is clear for the first time in YEARS.  I haven\'t had a new break out in two weeks now (which is truly miraculous for me).  I still have areas that are healing (which is to be expected), but my skin is smooth.  No more bumps and red spots.  No more painful cystic acne.  I don\'t know if this is the solution for everyone with acne, but this worked for me.  It does feel weird to wash with until you get used to it.  I am used to using products that leave your face ""squeaky clean"".  This is more like washing with what feels like a lotion.  It is fragrance free, which is a definite plus for anyone (like me) with sensitive skin.  But my face is smooth and no longer flaky and tight feeling like it was before.  Definitely worth trying if you suffer from acne.\n\n', ""\n\n  This was too hydrating for me. I didn't feel clean after washing my face with it and it left a greasy feel. I won't be buying this again.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have normal to slightly oily skin but in the winter I have very dry skin and some facial eczema.  I used this product for a week during the winter.  It honestly feels like your cleaning your face with hand lotion.  And my face wasn't fresh and clean after using the product.  It still felt oily in my T zone.  I won't be using this again,\n\n"", ""\n\n  This supposedly gentle cleanser burned like crazy when I put it on. I did this on 3 separate occasions with no other product on my face and it happened all 3 times. I didn't want to break out so I washed it off immediately and gave it to my husband instead. Not good for even mildly sensitive skin.\n\n"", '\n\n  Good size, will last for a long time.Works very well, leaves my skin feeling clean but hydrated. Even removes mascara well without irritating my eyes. Does not look the most fancy of all cleansers but is a good price and works so well, I keep it in a cupboard anyway so I don’t mind!Recommended by Nadine Bagggott on YouTube and am very pleased with this find!\n\n', '\n\n  I know the product is great, but the packaging being a piece of cellotape of the pump is atrocious\n\n', ""\n\n  Loved this, my skin is extremely dry so it's good this this cleanser has hydrating properties. I have switched to cera ve products and within a few days I have noticed my skin begin to clear. Love this product, would highly recommend.\n\n"", '\n\n  its like a cream and you wash it off does leave skin feeling moist but its nothing special for the price.\n\n', ""\n\n  It is a great sized bottle and will last forever, it's everything i need in a wash, it still makes me feel like i've cleaned my face well without feeling the need to do a heavy duty scrub. It does work just have patience!My skin isn't super sensitive but my skin is so prone to flare up one after the other and the blemishes themselves are sensitive so this is amazing for that because it doesn't scrape away skin and isn't invasive at all.\n\n""]"

","[""\n\n  I used this product only for a week, and I can see the difference in my enamel. It felt stronger, looks more full and my teeth always sparkle when I use it... I have two porcelain veneers on my front tooth, and I am required to use low abrasive toothpaste to keep the glaze of the porcelain shining for years to come.. This toothpaste is gentle whitening and although it made my teeth felt stronger, full and sparkle...... Only 1 week of use, it made my teeth more yellow and somewhat of a dry mouth.... The more I used it, the more my teeth became yellower kinda like an orange color of a carrot.. People say it took them a couple of weeks or maybe a month for this toothpaste to whiten... However, I don't think it will do it for me.... I'll tell you this though... If you already have a white teeth, and if you use this toothpaste your teeth will feel stronger, and it will sparkle and shine like you're coming out of a dentist.. I had to switch toothpaste brand to get my teeth color back... Maybe, I'll alternate between two toothpaste..... I don't really need this brand of toothpaste anyways since my teeth were never sensitive.... It works, but it just changed the color of my teeth badly..... Another brand of low abrasive toothpaste I am using is arm and hammer extreme advanced whitening just for anybody wondering what was my alternative toothpaste...\n\n"", ""\n\n  I do like this toothpaste, but the cap design has become impossible to use.  Over time, paste collects in the grooves and it gets clogged making it a pain to close and do the snap thing.  Add to that, the fact that someone thought it a great idea to cut down on the thickness of the plastic tube itself, so the entire package twists around as it gets empty, preventing a way to get a purchase on it.  Really a pain.UPDATE:So because I dislike wasted money, I suffered through use of all three tubes.  I will not purchase again because I don't know if it's the Alpine Breeze flavor (very chemical and not really peppermint but some kind of artificial approximation that burns), but in all three cases, when I got to the end of the tube, contracted mouth sores and had to toss it.  Not a big fan.\n\n"", '\n\n  I have some gum recession from over bleaching my teeth in my 20’s and also from being in braces on two separate occasions for over five years! The metal braces caused a lot of my gum recession versus Invisalign treatment I had as well. This product is gentle but yet effective in getting the teeth clean and mouth fresh. There is no abrasive grit to any of the Sensodyne toothpastes. The mint flavor is my favorite. The average tube lasts me a month brushing twice daily. I do notice a difference honestly with the “whitening” Sensodyne only if you are using regularly & ongoing. I have some sensitivity issues with regular toothpastes but not with using Sensodyne.\n\n', '\n\n  My dentist told me I needed to start using Sensodyne to help with very slightly sensitive teeth. I could eat hot and cold foods/drinks just find. Ice cream was the only thing that would make my teeth hurt for 2 seconds. Now after using this product for a couple weeks even room temp water kills my teeth. SO much pain!!! I have to brush and waterpik with warm water to keep the pain away. So disappoint. Now I have 3 tubes of toothpaste I no longer want and was a waste of money!!\n\n', '\n\n  This is my new favorite toothpaste! I am almost done with one. I have 2 more left before i have to restock. This makes my teeth feel stronger and better. I follow instructions. I put the timer on my phone for 1 minute then brush until the timer goes off. It says to use it twice a day (a minute each) and to not exceed 3 minutes using this product in one day. Im a sticker to the rules when it comes to using products. I love this one and will be restocking when i run out.Edit: so I don’t really care about the timing anymore. But it’s been my go-to toothpaste. I don’t think I can live without this anymore haha.\n\n', ""\n\n  I've been using it for a couple years now and this stuff works. Package arrived as expected with 3 individually sealed tubes of toothpaste.\n\n"", '\n\n  I had damaged some nerves in my gums and thought that I might need a root canal.

I must say that this is a first, and isn't there always a first for every product. Who was the jackass that thought this cap on the tube worked, and was a great idea. He was fired right. I hope so. This is the crazy cap that doesn't make a lick of sense, and should never be made again. The one thing I don't want in a tube is to fight with it first thing in the morning. Nope.\n\n"", '\n\n  Dentro de la gama de pastas de dientes que maneja la marca Sensodyne, esta es la que mejores resultados me ha dado, creo que es la mejor que tiene porque ayuda a fortalecer y a hacer mas resistente el esmalte dental; con un uso constante controla muy bien la sensibilidad.\n\n', '\n\n  Nice product\n\n', '\n\n  Muy buena pasta y buen diseño del tubo.\n\n', '\n\n  FELIZ\n\n', '\n\n  Love it\n\n']"

","[""\n\n  I bought this product because I know a lot of professional cleaners who use it and swear by it. After having tested it in my oven and on my glass shower I'm not very impressed. It definitely cleaned, but not any better than the other products I have for the oven or the shower. In fact, I thought it was pretty messy applying it, then wiping it off, then shining with a cloth. Overall it cleans, but there are plenty of other products that do the same.\n\n"", '\n\n  This stuff is really amazing! It worked really great on a stove surface that I couldn’t clean out for a while. I wish it was more accessible in the US.\n\n', '\n\n  This is the best cleaning product ever. It didn’t take me much time doing it and left my oven like new! Thank you!\n\n', ""\n\n  After seeing this on tiktok I was so excited to try it. I saw multiple videos, but one of the videos I saw that motivated me to try it was one of a lady who was cleaning a door with pen marks all over it and after applying the product the marks were gone. I have a similar problem, pen marks on my door too. So I bought it and did exactly what the lady did on the video. To my disappointment it didn't work. I still have the pen marks on my door, although they are slightly faded. So it didn't work for what I originally bought it for unfortunately. But afterwards my door was cleaner.  Also to add on to my disappointment, it was causing my paint on my door to chip off in multiple areas. Must be the ingredients in the actual product.\n\n"", '\n\n  I got this after reading about it on a FB cleaning group. I got it yesterday and cleaned my sink today. I have never seen it so clean! It removed the lime scale with a regular wash cloth and a little scrubbing.\n\n', ""\n\n  It's very abrasive. Works well but not safe for glass like it says\n\n"", '\n\n  I need this in bulk!! I have tried so many cleaning solutions to get out hard cooking stains on my stove top and nothing worked! This stuff took it right out without a problem!!\n\n', '\n\n  Returns stainless sinks and fixtures to ""new"" quality luster, even after many years of use. Same with porcelain.\n\n', '\n\n\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \xa0This stuff is absolutely fantastic. It’ll clean pretty much anything.Be careful though as it’s a bit gritty and can put light scratches into the things you’re rubbing / cleaning, it’s almost like a paste version of a fine sand paper, a bit like Cif, like T-Cut but this Pink Stuff tops it all.Large tub filled to the top, this will last me forever. A little bit goes a long way, I find it’s best to be used on a damp cloth and rub lightly.I’ve cleaned metal radiators with rust, some scratches in my car paintwork but I had to buff it over after as it put swirl marks on the paint, cleaned the oven a treat, it’ll even work on hard oil and grease, and rust. I haven’t found anything yet that it can’t clean.Also it doesn’t have much of a scent at all to it which is great.Quick bit of advice, try and source it somewhere else if you want to save a bit of money, I found it in a diy shop for £1.99 for the same size tub, suppose if you’ve got prime, you’re paying for next day delivery which could be handy.Check out my video of the paste of me simply rubbing some on an aluminium ladder leg, it’s brilliant.If this review was helpful, please could you click the ‘Helpful’ button below.\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing , got the rust of the radiator so easy and quick . Very impressed\n\n', '\n\n  I’ve attached before and after photo! This stuff is amazing! Bought on a recommendation from a friend who uses this stuff as a cleaner in a college. I was going to change my rusty towel rail because it was old and rusty. Used this and it’s litrally brand new again!\n\n', '\n\n  This stuff is amazing guys, I live in rented accommodation, so when I saw two dark rings appear on my upvc window sill, I thought oh my god, there goes the bond! tried strong bleach and scrubbing, nothing worked, got this and after 30 secs of scrubbing started to fade after another min all gone with no damage or scratch marks, I used a kitchen washing up sponge, and just a pea sized amount, it foams up a bit.\n\n', '\n\n  I purchased this the first week of September at £3.99! It has increased dramatically in price to over £6! I was going to purchase another for my daughter, think I will compare prices online. That said this is an amazing product, I purchased it initially to clean the Oven Extractor Fan, it cleaned through the grime with very little effort. A small amount rubbed into the area your cleaning with a little non abrasive cleaning pad and then wiped with a white cleaning cloth did the trick. I then thought I would try my front door, it has a few scuff marks on the White UPVC and following the same procedure my door came up like new. So yes I would recommend but feel the huge price increase in only four weeks is terrible on the consumer so I’m taking my business elsewhere, hence the four star review.\n\n']"

","[""\n\n  Are you really reading reviews on toothpaste? Lets just stop and think about that. Wait am I actually stopping what i am doing and seriously reviewing this?  Well we are sad. Lets be sad together :) On with the review.....It is your standard toothpaste. I am not a dentist, but i would assume they would approve (they approve everything). The taste is really good and I don't have cavities. That concludes everything you want in your toothpaste :) The addition of Scope is quite delightful. I keeps my mouth feeling clean for longer periods of time. This has a physiological advantage of helping you lose weight. WHAAAAAAT???? yes it does. Typically people do not want to eat after brushing their teeth. So the longer the taste lasts, the longer you feel like you just brushed, the longer you go before eating.This is a great value to purchase on Subscribe & Save. This will give you a nice stockpile to prevent you from having to remember to buy new tubes as often.\n\n"", '\n\n  Gives me canker sores.\n\n', ""\n\n  These tubes are very large, they came in wrapped together just as shown in the picture. The taste isn't too strong and the freshness lasts for about an hour or a lil more. I have braces and these really get the job done 👍🏼\n\n"", ""\n\n  Good value for standard toothpaste. I don't think it whitens your teeth but it does feel like a stronger product than Tom's or Sensodyne. After using this toothpaste, you get a fresh minty flavor in your mouth.  For the price, I think it might have been cheaper than Costco.\n\n"", '\n\n  I’ve been using this product for years, and am completely satisfied with the results.  The Scope infused toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling clean without that horrible after taste left behind by some toothpastes.  Additionally, I have never cared for those strong minty flavored toothpastes; this product is just strong enough to give you a lasting clean mouth feeling.\n\n', '\n\n  arrived fast, but I thought they were bigger\n\n', '\n\n  There was something very wrong with this product.  It is the exact same toothpaste I had just run out of and the exact same toothpaste that I purchased again locally, but the tubes that were delivered to me tasted terrible.  I tried 2 of the 3 tubes and they were the same.  They weren’t past the expiration date and they looked normal, just tasted wrong.\n\n', ""\n\n  I love this toothpaste and ordered the 3 pack.  It arrived and i just stored it in the cupboard until i needed a fresh tube.  I opened the cellophane package today to remove one of the 3 boxes and found one box still closed but completely empty.  so in my case whatever economy might have been achieved by buying 3 at once was reduced to whatever price point two at once might have been.  Don't wait to open the cello wrapped 3 pack of boxes.  Open and check contents before storing\n\n"", '\n\n  This is my favourite toothpaste and can be hard to find in Londo ... and usually quite expensive. This is well priced and arrived on time\n\n', '\n\n  buen paquete\n\n']"

","['\n\n  Before I say anything else, I have owned a bunch of actual Beauty Blenders.These makeup sponges are REAL Beauty Blender dupes. They are just as soft as the real one. They don’t absorb a lot of product which is a huge no no when I purchase makeup sponges. I got tired of paying $20 for each Beauty Blender (I use 2 while applying makeup daily). I use them dry for full coverage but they do get larger when wet. They wash amazingly. Because they don’t absorb a lot of product, it is very easy to wash them. I just use Dr. Bronners bar soap (peppermint) and water to cleanse. Perfection. 5 makeup blenders for 50% less than an Original Beauty Blender. Yes please!!\n\n', '\n\n  I’m honestly really stinking happy with my little sponges. They double in size as soon as you get them damp but they don’t soak up like any of my foundation so nothing goes to waste. It applys my makeup smoothly and works just as well as a beauty blender but for a fraction of the price. Totally worth it. You can see that it does stay a larger size when it’s dry after it’s been used vs the blue one I haven’t used yet.\n\n', '\n\n  The sponges expand nicely once damp, and felt spongier and more dense than the RT sponge. They are very soft, as well. They feel more rough when bouncing on the skin, but I would attribute that to the greater density. The classic Beauty Blender has a more luxurious texture and more porosity, but is gentler during application.(Using started Shapetape) I really liked the coverage that this sponge provided over the Real Technique one. I was over paying $20 per BB and sought the RT as a cost-efficient replacement, but was overall dissapointed with their performance. I was honestly surprised at how well these sponges performed, given their cost.Overal, as for performance, I would give The Beauty Blender 5, BEAKEY 4, And Real Techniques a 3. HOWEVER-the low cost and high value of the BEAKEY sponges has earned them a 5 Star.\n\n', ""\n\n  After paying $20 for one sponge in a department store I was aghast and delighted to find this set of several.  They do the jobs intended although you don't have the fine control of a brush for some things and I want a flat part, so cut I piece off with scissors.  That works great,  I've even been able to use the cut off piece for smaller jobs.  I also like that I can dedicate each color to a certain job and there no crossover, plus I still have backups when I want a completely clean one.  I've had no trouble washing them out, but expect they'll give out eventually.  At this point--frequent use over a couple of months, I see no sign of deterioration.\n\n"", '\n\n  I bought these after trying at least three other make up blenders, and these are by far the best. I never tried the original beauty blender because of the high price point for one, but I think these must work just as well, for a fraction of the cost. I tried at least two other similar sponge blenders and they worked pretty well, but with those, 1) I felt like they sucked up a lot of makeup, even damp, and 2) I felt like the sponge broke down and developed ""splits"" in the foam after only a few weeks. Given the price, I would have been satisfied with that, but then I stumbled upon these almost 6 months ago, and realized I had wasted money on those other products. These are fantastic. Seriously, I purchased these in March -Its now October- and I still have one left in the package, and only just started using the 4th one so I have a while to go before I\'m out. I\'m purchasing a new set right now though, which made me think to write this review.I believe some people use these dry, but I always use them wet; I think it helps with not sucking up so much make up to use a damp sponge. I also think it helps really blend the foundation into my skin (I tried those silicone ones and bleh! It was like mopping makeup all over my face, I could not get the makeup to blend smoothly!). I also think it helps to keep my face looking moisturized throughout the day. I have problem skin, with hormonal acne around my period, and cystic pimples that come out when I\'m stressed (which is often) and I use a lot of strong treatments on my face (salicylic acid, benzyl peroxide, tea tree oil, etc.) that can result in drying, peeling skin, and I feel like this sponge helps apply over these areas smoothly. I also tend to end up with scabs and think that the sponge also does a reasonable job to help camouflage these spots with concealer.I use the sponge each morning to put on my liquid foundation and sometimes concealer. I use an antibacterial gel soap (from bath and body works!) to gently work out the old makeup every day; it takes about 30 seconds, and it cleans up, almost like new each time. The only reason why I switch every 4-6 weeks is because the sponge will eventually develop cracks from daily use and cleaning, which doesn\'t allow the makeup to apply as smoothly. What is kind of strange is that I noticed that the pink ones seem to hold up and clean up much better than the other colors. Maybe that is just a coincidence.Overall, at $2.00 a sponge, I could not be happier. I have encouraged my sisters to purchase these, and encourage anyone reading to purchase as well. I really don\'t know how I ever applied makeup with my fingers!\n\n', '\n\n  These are softer the a Real Techniques beauty blender but still work great. These are by far a better deal, they work the same but are cheaper and you get more sponges for your buck. I will definitely purchase again. Also arrived right on time. Sorry a few other things randoms in the picture but wanted to show they are just like the photo online.\n\n', '\n\n  I would say these are very comparable high end blending sponges for a fraction of the price. Easy to use, soft, applies foundation & blends my bronzer well. They also are a lot easier to clean than many of the blending sponges I have used in the past - not sure why, but definitely a major plus!\n\n', ""\n\n  love these things! this is my second order and I tend to go through sponges pretty quickly (fear of germs, don't judge). PRICE is perfect and I like the feel of these much better than a $20 beauty blender. they clean well, blend amazingly, and help pick up any extra I may have applied. works great dry with powders also!!!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I am a certified makeup artist and I have used almost every makeup sponge on the market. Latex free triangles, beauty blender, real techniques, eco tools... this works just as good as all of the others I've tried. The point on the end gets right under my eye beautifully, and around my nose as well. If you wet the sponge it does not absorb as much product as the reviewers below say it does. I use one pump of foundation and it covers my whole face seamlessly, and I use a couple of small stripes of concealer and it covers my undereye and my eyelid with no issues. If it is used dry, I can imagine it would absorb makeup more as the sponge gets MUCH larger when wet, but I find wetting any sponge will help give you that airbrushed effect. Wet your sponge, squeeze most of the water out, and then wrap the sponge in a face towel to absorb excess moisture. I will definitely be buying these again, and have recommended them to friends.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I've been meaning to buy a multi pack for years, but they were always too pricey, until I saw this pack.I am chuffed I bought them as they are great.Reasonably priced, well packed and work well with my make up.  They are soft, but built to last as dont flake bits off.  They wash well too.\n\n"", '\n\n  Fantastic for the money, a little more dense than branded sponges but work just as well. They expand huge and they’re very soft. I will definitely repurchase these instead of more expensive ones.\n\n', '\n\n  1st Star: comes in variety of colors2nd Star: affordable3rd Star: sponge expands well with water winithin seconds4th Star: sponge is fabricated to be a perfect balance between soft and sturdy 5th Star: blends foundation and concealer effortlessly¤ First image is the sponge dry¤Second image is of the sponge wet¤Third image is just a camparison of how big it is next to nail polish bottle\n\n', '\n\n\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \xa0I actually really do love these. 100% A1\n\n']"

","['\n\n  My dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush because I scrub too hard. [Aside: that may have something to do with my mom being an orthodontic assistant and saying things like, ""If you\'re gums don\'t bleed, you\'re not brushing hard enough.""] Either way, I picked a midrange brush with a pressure sensor and a quandrant time.First of all, my teeth have never felt this clean at home! Only after a dental appointment with all the gritty bits and water pistol rinsing and anxiety and mess. It\'s amazing! I even didn\'t brush this morning to see how long the feeling would last, and it\'s almost noon and still... smooth and clean!I read through the manual (don\'t roll your eyes - I was looking for how the pressure sensor worked!) and it mentioned this toothbrush has an EasyStart mode that slowly increases the performance of the brush over the first 14 uses to get you accustomed to brushing.So I\'m thinking, ""I\'m a 30-something who\'s been brushing since I could stand. How seriously different can this be?""I placed the brush against my back teeth like the manual recommended and then turned it on - WOW. I have never had a whole-head sensation like that before! It tickled and buzzed so hard, I started laughing and couldn\'t stop for the entire two minute brush timer. I missed three of the four ""move to a new quadrant"" beeps because every time I rearranged the brush, the tingling changed and sent me off into gales of laughter again. It wasn\'t just LOLing, y\'all. My eye makeup was ruined, and I dribbled toothpaste all over the sink. My lazy little dog even came in to check on me. I had a full ab workout in two minutes.I understand why they try to get you accustomed to it - this is quite the experience. I\'m actually kinda looking forward to brushing my teeth again tonight.\n\n', ""\n\n  I've only used this product once and I'm already prepared to give it a 5 star rating. I've been using a cheap ~$10 oral-B electric toothbrush from Walmart for a few years now and decided to upgrade. This sonicare toothbrush is an insane difference. I turned off the easy start so that I could get the full effect and I'm thoutoughly impressed. It will vibrate your entire face it is so strong. The 2 minute timer is too short for me but I just run through the cycle twice, not worth taking a star off as this is personal preference and does not cause any trouble to use for more than one cycle. For $40 and a 2.5 year warranty I'm positive I will be happy in the long run. If it dies in 2.6 years (just after the warranty) I will feel like it was worth the money. If it stays alive that's even better. Great product. Go with this one since it has the lithium battery and the same power as the diamond toothbrush without unnecessary features.\n\n"", '\n\n  Update 8/23/18 -  Reconnected with Sonicare customer service who ultimately agreed to exchange for a new unit at no add’l cost to me, including all shipping. Have had it for a week and it seems to work as it should, the way we are accustomed to.  Appreciate Phillips standing behind their product.  I upgraded score from 1 star to 4 stars.Initial Review:  We were disappointed with this unit.  My wife and I have used Sonicares for almost 20 years, routinely buying mid-upper level models.  When our most recent unit began to fail holding charges and started getting noisier in use, we decided to replace it with this less expensive model because we did not use the variable speeds and other amenities provided on the higher cost units. Carefully reviewing the full power/intensity description of this model in comparison to others, we found it was supposed to be equivalent.From day one this unit was noisier in use than the others we have owned and it was noticeably weaker in power/intensity.  Since we are accustomed to full power I thought during set up I had bypassed the new user break-in cycling that starts with low intensity and incrementally increases over a week or so.I called Sonicare customer service who was courteous. We walked through their troubleshooting checklist that included bypassing the new user ramp up to full intensity. As I said above I thought I had set it up for full intensity but I had to admit to the CSR that the intensity seemed to improve/increase when we reset the bypass again and I tried it in my mouth for 10-15 seconds while he waited on the phone. By the end of the next day the power/intensity went back to being 30-40% lower than we are used to with other Sonicares. Since this, and most models now use Lithium batteries I keep it on the charger when not in use. I also tried resetting the intensity adjustment multiple times over a couple weeks, and sometimes it almost seems like the strength increases slightly for 1/2 day. It never equalling our previous units. In general, the intensity strength of this unit Is so low that when you try to do the anterior surface of your side teeth/molars, the bristle vibration seems to almost stop.Perhaps our unit is a fluke. Given the one year warranty, I will soon recontact their customer service to ask if we can exchange this one for another of the same model.\n\n', '\n\n  I\'ve used Sonicare brushes for 10 years, and this one is the best of the lot for a budget price.  You can pay 4 times as much and get the bells and whistles, but if your main aim is to clean your teeth, this brush does it well.  It has a brisk action (which can be started out at a lower intensity for newcomers), a two minute timer with a quad pacer that beeps every 30 seconds, a ""smart brush"" detection system that alerts you when the brush head needs to be replaced, and an alert when you\'re pressing too hard with the brush head.  If you want your teeth clean and don\'t need whitening mode, bluetooth, and a lot of other luxury features, this brush will do the job.NOTE: When you buy replacement brush heads (this unit  comes with only one), buy Phillips brush heads. Do NOT purchase the economy ones.  They are poor quality, wear our quickly, and can actually damage your teeth and/or gums.  Always buy the Phillips brand.\n\n', '\n\n  Teeth feel so much cleaner vs. regular brushing.  Takes a few times to get used to the vibrations and the pressure you apply the bristles to your teeth and gums.  You have to be gentle and let the toothbrush do the work.  So far so good.  Also has a high end look and feel and the charger is great.  I like it!\n\n', ""\n\n  This was unbearable to use. The vibration is SO strong that it tingled in a way that was extremely uncomfortable and vibrated through my entire head!!!! Awful. I had been using the Oral B electric toothbrush for years and decided to branch out and try this one, but immediately returned after two attempts. I also didn't like the functionality side of it - the brush head vibrates only, so you still need to create your own brushing motion, rather than the bristles actually spinning to clean/brush around the grooves of your teeth. Unless you fancy using this as a vibrator, do not recommend. Vibrations are extreme.\n\n"", '\n\n  This brush is my favourite electric toothbrush I’ve tried, my first one is just the cheap oral B one that is sold at Walmart for like 30 bux. This blows that one out of the pArk. My teeth have never felt cleaner :) I love the how the brush vibrates once when you have spent enough time on one side and totally stops when it’s been two minutes. It vibrates very fast but you get used to it.  I love the sleek black and white style, and comes with a little protective/sanitary plastic cover to put over your bristles when your brushing.\n\n', '\n\n  All the Philips Sonicare electronic toothbrush share the same problem: the engine trouble will make the vibration weird after a while use. I bought my first one in Costco and had to replace it for 4 times within the two-year warranty period, which means that it will get broken in the end of each 5 months only.And this Amazon one looks amazing until I used it. That strange vibration came back as a nightmare! However, that was my first use of this one. Which means that Amazon sold me a second hand product! That is discussing! Be aware of what they send you!\n\n', ""\n\n  I'm a first time user of electric toothbrushes. I like how this Sonicare has a 'EasyStart' feature built in which helps new users like me gradually get used to the power of the vibrations from the brush over the first 14 days of use. It definitely feels weird/slightly uncomfortable on first few tries because I'm not used to using an electric toothbrush and its' vibrations on my teeth. Also ticklish on the inner top front teeth. It's really useful that the brush turns off after 2 minutes so I know I'm not over or under brushing, unlike when I would when I used a manual brush. The biggest drawback I could see is the expensive Philips Sonicare brush heads compared to Oral- B brush heads. Also, I wouldn't trust using the off-brand brush heads we see on Amazon because they might not brush as effectively as Philips designed it to be.  Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase and happy to have cleaner teeth from now on.\n\n""]"

","[""\n\n  Been using this for awhile.our child has mixed hair w/curls.just dont use to much.it can become a lil greasy& weigh the hair down.We take a break & switch out the product.then go back.UPDATE: this product ate up our childs lenses.Were NOT happy about it.we had to buy 2 new paid of lenses for her glasses.because we couldn't figure out why her lenses had little dots on them.we showed her eye doctor& he said thats weird.I usually just spray water, but the second time.I just sprayed a little bit on her pony tail& it got on her lenses.i cleaned them off& yep.honest isnt honest anymore.It shouldn't leave like a melted speck.1star!!!!!\n\n"", '\n\n  My daughter has curly hair. A bit like Shirley Temple. This stuff smells really nice but I have seen no change at all in the tangles after coating her head in this stuff.\n\n', '\n\n  I love this stuff. It smells AMAZING, and it’s pretty much one of the few detanglers that actually works on my fine but thick hair. It also doesn’t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy, and I use it liberally. It just makes my hair gloriously soft. My only gripe is that the bottle is super small, and I go through it quickly. I’d knock a star off for that, if it didn’t work so well and smell so good. I’ve now just added it to my monthly subscribe-and-save, so even though I use it up quickly, at least I can save a little on the cost that way.\n\n', ""\n\n  This is my favorite detangler. It smells awesome and never weighs down my hair. I try to avoid silicone and this is silicone free. I bleached my hair beyond repair and ended up getting a very short pixie cut. Now it's past my shoulders and I still spray this in my towel dried hair before combing. I've tried other spray conditioners and this is the best. I reccomend this to friends and family all the time.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I wish I could give this product 10 stars for its amazing scent! It smells like a creamsicle and is quite literally the best hair detangler I've ever used in more than 30 years of having long hair. I have to mention that I'm usually very sensitive to smells but the smell of this product does not bother me at all, probably because it is natural. I will absolutely be buying this product again!\n\n"", ""\n\n  I purchased this to supplement a sub-par conditioner that I was trying to muscle through using, but it didn't really work for me. Firstly, the orange cream scent is sickly sweet. Secondly, it didn't really seem to do all that much in the way of detangling. I still had plenty of knots to work through after spraying this liberally on my long, fine hair. Wouldn't purchase again.\n\n"", ""\n\n  My daughter is almost 6 months old and her hair is abnormally long, stick straight, and wispy. She is in that stage where she rolls all over the floor and her hair gets tangled and messy. This spray is perfect! It is a nice weight, doesn't make her hair seem greasy by any means, gives it a bit of texture and weight so it isn't flying away everywhere and it smells really nice. She was having some dry scaly cradle cap type patches as well and this leave in conditioner has helped with that a lot. They have been disappearing since I started using this product. A little goes a long way with it too, I imagine one bottle will last at least 2-3 months. For the price it's already a great value, but it really is a quality product as well. I'm glad I found it, I have used other leave in conditioner de tangling sprays before and they leave hair feeling greasy or you can feel the product in the hair, I like that this isn't that way. Would highly recommend.\n\n"", '\n\n  I was very surprised by this detangling spray - delighted! I have thinning, fine blond, wavy hair that tangles horribly. Brushing my hair has always been such a chore. Many conditioners and detangling sprays leave my thin hair weighted down and greasy. Not this one! So far I love it! I use Honest brand conditioner in the shower, then use 2-3 sprays of Honest Detangling Spray on the ends of my hair when I get out of the shower.I was worried that the glowing reviews here were fake but decided to risk it and buy the product... So glad I did! I received quite a few complements on my hair at work the first day I tried it!\n\n']"

","[""\n\n  I have been using the old formula. However, as my stocks were running out, I came back to Amazon and was surprised to read about the new formula and all the negative reviews against it.I bought another brand that used the old formula as a stopgap measure. But I read later on that a key ingredient in the old formula, sodium perborate, was possibly carcinogenic, and was in fact banned for use in the EU. The new formula had supposedly removed it.Therefore, I decided to take a chance with the new formula. Guess what? None of the negative reviews were true and the new formula cleaned my retainers just as well, if not better.I have attached two photos that clearly show the ingredient list in both old and new formulas. (In fact, you might notice that the negative reviews that have photos do not show the ingredient list clearly at all.)The first photo (with ©2015 DENTSPLY) is the old formula, and the second photo (with ©2018 Dentsply Sirona) is the new formula.The key changes in the new formula from the old one are:1. Replacement of sodium perborate with sodium percarbonate. Both are oxidising agents that have the cleaning effect of detergents like Oxiclean. However, because sodium perborate might be carcinogenic, this is a good substitute.2. Removal of pentasodium triphosphate and tetrasodium etidronate (EDTA), which are both water softeners.3. Addition of citric acid, which acts as both a water softener and for effervescence.4. Addition of tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED), which is an oxidising agent like sodium percarbonate, but more potent. It is a powerful disinfectant against bacteria, viruses, and fungi.The new formula is clearly a better product than the old.There was a review that claimed that the new formula's primary ingredient is sodium bicarbonate whereas the old was potassium persulfate — that is simply not true. Both ingredient lists contain both sodium bicarbonate and potassium persulfate. Read the ingredient list and ascertain it for yourself. The manufacturer was not misleading anyone, but that reviewer was.I do not know what are the motives of these negative reviewers, but I suspect they are hired to damage the reputation of this product in favor of another brand, which sells the old and potentially carcinogenic retainer cleansing tablets.Do yourself a favor and don't listen to those negative reviews.\n\n"", '\n\n  The new box contains a completely different formula. The primary ingredient now is Baking Soda  (Sodium Bicarbonate), whereas the old box had as its primary ingredient Potassium Persulfate (oxidizing agent)The manufacturer has decided to mislead customers -  now you are purchasing a very expensive mix of primarily baking soda and citric acid.\n\n', ""\n\n  From a 8 year registered dental hygienist experience, this product suddenly turned into the cheap tablets you get at the drug stores called Polident. Smells and tastes nasty. I already suspected something was going to be different because the tablets' color looks lighter. I have used the original retainer Brite for many years so I was able to compare.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Definitely the best product of its type available. In the attached picture are three sets of Invisalign trays. The one on the left is fresh out of the pouch. The other two were used for two weeks; the middle set was cleaned every morning with Retainer Brite and the one on the right was cleaned every morning with Fresh Guard.Everything else was the same - I didn't drink anything other than clear liquids while they were in, and I (obviously) didn't eat anything. It's very clear - pun intended - which product I'll use moving forward.\n\n"", '\n\n  Does not work as described! Does not turn white after 20 minutes as original sample I received from the orthodontist, does not clean at all, does not work buyer beware*UPDATE*The 1st product I received came in the “new look box” all white box, which didn’t work at all. I was sent a replacement in the original box and the product works 100% as it states and as the sample I received from the orthodontist. However I am not changing my rating as the first one I received didn’t work and consumers should be aware of that.\n\n', ""\n\n  I have been using these for 6 months with aligners.  My past two orders worked well and as directed; however, the new tablets being shipped are in new packaging and the tablets appear to be different.  The product no longer works as directed.  Blue water doesn't turn clear even after 20-30 minutes.  The product also leaves chemical odor and taste on aligners even after rinsing thoroughly.  I have ordered twice thinking I may have received a bad batch, but the poor results are still the same.\n\n"", '\n\n  I\'ve been using Retainer Brite for about a year to clean my Invisalign.  The product I\'d been using is through Dentsply Essex and came in a blue-ish purple box (see photo below).  It worked great!  The product I\'m reviewing, through Dentsply Sirona and comes in a white box, is horrible.  The ""old"" version of Retainer Brite had a mint flavor and turned the water from blue to clear as cleaning/disinfecting was completed, always within 15-20 minutes.  This ""new"" (white box) Retainer Brite tastes and smells horrible, and stays blue (instead of turning clear as it\'s supposed to when cleaning is complete) for...I don\'t know how long.  The longest I left my aligners in the cleaner was 30 minutes, and it was still blue.  Even though I rinsed it thoroughly before wearing, my Invisalign tasted terrible from the Retainer Brite.  I just hope I can find the ""old"" version again!\n\n', ""\n\n  Used to have the purple box and the product worked great. I received the white box and the formula has changed. Blue water doesn't turn to clear and left a bad taste. Unfortunately Amazon wont let me return this. I cant find this in any local store. So I'm stuck with a defective product and I'm scared to try to buy another box for fear I will get the new box again. Does anyone have another product that works on Invisalign retainers?\n\n"", ""\n\n  I have bruxism and wear a dental guard at night.  I noticed that the guard was starting to smell and the usual transparent aspect had turned cloudy.  I use a Retainer Brite tablet and it didnt do anything. Still abit smelly and still cloudy. I tried again.  This time the water was abit hotter and i left it soaking for longer. No effect.I took up a toothbrush, turned on the cold tap and started to clean the retainer. Success.Now i'm left with 94 useless tablets.\n\n"", '\n\n  I’ve always used retainer brite to clean my Invisalign they are so good. But I think they have changed the packaging and the product. The tablets don’t seem as powerful and they don’t foam up at all like they use to. Such a shame.\n\n', ""\n\n  I have had fixed braces as an adult and now a couple of years on just need to wear retainers at night. On a good day (i.e. I haven't slept through my alarm clock) I put my retainers in a plastic pot with half of one of these tablets and some water. When I come back to them at the end of the day I give them a rinse and I can pop the retainers straight in- simple and easy. On a less organised day I will pop a whole tablet in the tub with warm water and they clean to go in about 10 minutes. I find using this strategy means I only need to give my braces a really deep clean with a toothbrush once a month (of course this varies on how much you need to wear yours).For parents with children with retainers I would definitely recommend these as it is just so much easier than needing to clean them with a toothbrush every night.For adults with retainers - the same applies!\n\n"", '\n\n  As recommended by my dentist, I use 1 x tablet every 3 days to soak my nighttime gum shields for 15 minutes. At this rate of use, one box lasts me about 9 months. My gum shields are 2 years old now, and the plastic, although a little coloured, is fairly clear. I have found that as they have aged the shields have developed a bit of a taste when first put in the mouth. As I clean with toothpaste and brush between tablets, I have taken to leaving a bit of toothpaste residue in the shields to give a minty taste.\n\n', ""\n\n  I use these daily to clean my Invisalign aligners and they work very well. I rinse the aligners before and after leaving them in the solution for 10 minutes, and they come out clear and don't have a cloudy finish like other cleaning tablets have left. Occasionally I need to clean the aligners with a tooth brush if there is something stuck on them, but I wouldnt expect this product to clean that off since it is targeting bacteria. At my last dentist visit to get my new aligners, my dentist remarked that my old aligners looked very clean and hygienic, so I will continue to use this to clean them.\n\n""]"

","['\n\n  A total waste of money. I ignored the reviews about the “bad smell” thinking I would get a good batch and was wrong. Thanks to this seller I’m never going to purchase soap bars from Amazon again. I’m sticking with Walmart or Sam’s Club, etc. When I received these Dove soap bars, they smelled nothing like Dove. I have been using Dove products for years and never had a problem. These soap bars smelled of filth! It was a filthy nasty stinge to every single one of them. I opened one thinking maybe the smell won’t linger on the skin after some lathering with water, NOPE! It made my hands stink of a strong disgusting mold-like filth, gosh it’s so hard to explain but it was terrible! If you feel like wasting your money and finding out for yourself, go right ahead. I’m donating these and purchasing my Dove products from trusted stores. I’m so disappointed, this seller lost all credibility with not only me but other buyers as well— what a waste of money. What in the world could possibly make soap smell like that?! Never again.\n\n', ""\n\n  This came in a box of 8x2 and smelled absolutely nothing like the original product.  As you can see by many other reviews this is a common theme with this particular product.  Amazon you need to pull this listing and do a serious inventory check on where these are coming from and find the source of the issue.DO NOT BUY thinking you will get real product. Don't even chance it.\n\n"", '\n\n  I think this product is a fake. It has a terrible chemical odor. The bar also has a strange texture. It’s either fake or bad!\n\n', ""\n\n  The boxes match *exactly* with the Dove soap I've been using for years, but the soap I received had a strong scent to it that is not present in the soap I've been using.  I hate the smell, so I'll donate it and go back to buying from the grocery store so I can be sure I'm getting what I want.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This product doesn't seem to the same as original Dove. It doesn't have the same aroma and cleansing affect as the original. Even the brand marking is so imperfect which makes you think if this is an aftermarket version! I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n"", '\n\n  I just got this order today and I opened the box a  Weird smell come out and smells so bad not like the original Soap smell , I believe this bar are fake. I will send it back\n\n', '\n\n  I have bought these several times. I was hesitant as the OZ was .25 different and all the bad reviews. I double checked to make sure that it was the same link I bough previously and it was. When I got them I compared them in detail. They seem to be the same size, same Dove soap, they do seem more scented however I opened an old box and a new box. I used both soaps. I think because I do not have to buy bar soap often when you buy 2 -8 packs for a great price the soap i have been using actually smelled ""old"" more than the new ones being ""more scented"" as I don\'t think to rotate soap so the 4 oz bars could have been bought 2xs ago?! Both lathered the same, moisturize the same and I\'m hypersensitive to soaps especially bar, laundry detergent ect. No reaction. Doesn\'t have any questions of being a fraud? I feel it is the same Dove sensitive bar soap I buy online and in stores. Even the size wasn\'t a big difference. Comes in 2 individually wrapped 8 bar packs with another do not break packaging. I took pictures so you can see. Hope this helps from my date of purchase as this is a great price for great soap!\n\n', ""\n\n  Great soap for someone who is allergic to the world.I pretty much break out in hives from anything, this is safe for me, and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry and itchy! Been a loyal customer for years!\n\n"", '\n\n  El jabón es una recomendación médica para el cuidado de la piel de mi hijo\n\n', '\n\n  Mejor jabón si tienes piel sensible y/o seco.\n\n', '\n\n  The perfect soap for dry and sensitive skin.\n\n', '\n\n  Great for sensitive skin.  Good price and fast shipping.\n\n', '\n\n  Had ordered for a family friend. They are happy with the product\n\n']"

","['\n\n  I’ve tried a lot of heat protectors and straighteners, but this is the best one yet. It doesn’t make my hair difficult to brush or sticky, like many of them. My hair is so soft and conditioned, and straightened very easily. I don’t even think it’s meant to be a straightening product, but when you have thick curly hair, it still makes the process sooo much easier. I love the fine mist, too. I washed and sprayed my hair, then went to bed, and in the morning I finished blow drying (if you have curls you know it still isn’t dry overnight lol) and flat ironed. Beautiful results! I’ll be reordering for sure.\n\n', '\n\n  Use this religiously. I spray it in my hair when I get out of the shower and it has made my curls come back that I ruined for ironing, and my hair stays down and doesn’t poof up when it dries. I love it, I’ve already ordered it twice.\n\n', '\n\n  This is by far the best heat protectant spray I have ever used. It smells amazing and leaves my hair silky and smooth. If you need a great professional product at a great price this is for you.\n\n', ""\n\n  This hair protector is a wide spray for light coverage of a larger area. My hair is thick and past my shoulders, and it only takes about 4 sprays to cover it. It smells great (kind of like baby powder), and the baby powder scent lasts until my next shampoo. I only wash my hair every other (or even third) day, so I think that's pretty good from only 4 sprays. My hair feels instantly soft and silky. Will definitely buy again!\n\n"", '\n\n  My hair was so soft after applying it before using my Bed Head waver and it smells really good too!\n\n', ""\n\n  Got this product as part of my Christmas gift. I added it to my wish list due to all the great reviews. I have to say that I've had hair issues since I can consciously remember and have tried product after product. I have a lot of hair, and it's frizzy, which has led me to use a straightener every day of my life since middle school. So far, I have definitely noticed  a difference in my hair. I would say the product certainly does what it says. I normally use it after I shower on wet or damp hair. I then blow dry and straighten it. Definitely makes my hair feel smoother, shiny, no frizz and faster to flat iron. It doesn't weigh my hair down and there is no icky residue like all the other products I've used. Other products leave my hair feeling weighed down or just gross to put my hands through. I have like 10 bottles of unused hair products that have promised the same things and let me down. I'm pleasantly surprised that this product won't end up like the others. Will definitely purchase more. The smell of the product can be a bit strong initially but at the end of the day it's worth it!\n\n"", '\n\n  This is just perfect. Im definitely buying again.\n\n', ""\n\n  I've used a couple of heat protectors when doing my hair but nothing big. BUT... this stuff is A-MA-ZING! not only leaves my hair super silky but it also gets all those stubborn little hairs in place. It also makes my hair look super healthy and makes the straightening job much easier.\n\n"", '\n\n  This straightens my hair lovely, without drying it. Took a while to arrive because it comes from America, but I knew that before I ordered it.\n\n', '\n\n  The product as a product is a good quality but the spray thing doesn’t work at all. I had to put it in another spray bottle to work. I didn’t ask to replace it because I leave in cyprus and it came from the United States it was going to take time for it to send it back and wait for a new one\n\n', '\n\n  I’ll begin by saying I have super long, thick, wavy yet frizzy when not blow dried hair. I’ve got a really expensive hairdryer and a really good quality brush. I use organic shampoo and condition. However, let me tell you.. I have never had such amazing hair after each blow dry prior to using this product. It makes my hair feel sooo soft, it’s shiny and sleek, it’s not frizzy at all and it protects my hair from the heat. Best thing I have ever bought. I highly recommend!\n\n', '\n\n  Combinándolo con la secadora babyliss portofino, dejó mi cabello sumamente suave, brillante y se ve saludable, es una muy buena opción de protector termal.\n\n', ""\n\n  it leaves my hair soft, not greasy tho, I love the scent, but not sure how it protects my hair, I wouldn't buy again, I'm sure there are other products do the same job with a cheaper price.\n\n""]"

","[""\n\n  I received my first jar as a gift and didn't get what all the buzz was about until I did my research and learned how to use it. Now I love it and am about to order my 3rd jar. I think the negative reviews are because most people, like me, try to use it as a stand alone moisturizer. I learned that it is a humectant and and works well applied a WET skin to lock in moisture. Let it dry, then use whatever serums and moisturizers you prefer for day or night. Try it this way and I think you'll be pleased with the results.\n\n"", '\n\n  I used this product and thought it was okay. I had heard great things from friends about this moisturizer. When it ran out, I purchased another container from a local retailer and it was A COMPLETELY different product than the one I purchased on Amazon originally. Because I had never tried this product before, I didn’t know there was anything wrong. My advice...don’t buy any or skin care or beauty products off Amazon. I know I won’t be any longer.\n\n', '\n\n  So, I love this lotion, the real one. I have very sensitive skin and this was recommended to me by dermo. I loved it from the beginning and it worked really well to keep me moisturized. I started ordering it from amazon and had reordered maybe 9-10 times when I received a jar that was not at all the same product. When I opened the jar it had a strong chlorine smell. I sent it back to amazon for a replacement and the next jar was the same. I had used about 20 jars of this stuff before these two, I knew something was weird. I took it to my dermo and she agreed that it was off. I used it for a little to see if the ingredients were the same( before I showed my dermo)... maybe new formula? But it wasn’t as moisturizing and left my face with that smell that my boyfriend even pointed out. I went to target and bought one and of course, no scent, exactly how I remembered. Amazon refunded me the jar of whatever the heck I was putting on my face but be aware, if you get this and it has any hint of a smell, especially chlorine, send it back, that’s not right. I did also compare ingredients to see if they had changed anything and it all read the same. The product I got either went bad or was not the same thing, end of story. I’d give the real product a 5 across the board but just be careful with what you get. Maybe try target first to confirm what it should be like.\n\n', ""\n\n  I like this product. I feel like its what I needed in my skin care routine.I'm a puertorican guy(hairstylist) living in Florida. Im don't put just anything on my face because I know how I want my face to look and what I want from a face product. My skin care routine consists of: cleansing, serum, eye cream, moisturizer. I always felt like my face is dry with texture even though is oily and I use gentle products. I started using a glycolic acid serum which has helped with my texture. But this gel cream, along with the hydra booster mixed, and aplied before my moisturizer is exactly what I needed. Always felt my face tight even after using any rich moisturizer but what I needed is the water or wetness(hydration that this provides) I love it.I personally bought it because it was blue.The only thing I didn't like is that it didnt come with a second cap inside to protect the product.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Neutrogena Hydro Boost is nothing short of miraculous. I've never been more pleased with a facial moisturizer. I got it yesterday and used it right away. I was impressed with how smoothly it went on and was completely invisible. Even better, my skin didn't feel tight or coated. Then the miracle:  A couple of hours later, I looked in the mirror, and surprise, no dry, flakey skin. I assumed it just hadn't had time to get back to its dry condition, but this morning it still looks as smooth as it does in the summertime. This is the first time I've used a Neutrogena product, but it certainly won't be the last.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I'm not really sure whats in this that gave me a bad reaction everytime I would use it. I got it June 27th and started using it that night. I like to do my daily routine which is cleaning my face and then moisturizing. This is the only product I changed too, I saw the good reviews and decided to give it a try.. But when using it I noticed it stung I wasn't sure why, I started to get clogged pores, break out slightly, and my skin turned red. I first thought I had to get used to it but I cannot. I was using the Garnier moister rescue before and liked it but didn't like the sticky feeling or how my skin felt like it had a layer on it. I did like how after i would put this on no sticky feeling or sitting on the skin. I'm now switching to Garnier moister bomb hopefully will find better results.\n\n"", ""\n\n  This doesn't look like the original product, doesn't even smell like it, and the container looks damaged and it has a white label covering most of the jar, it doesn't have the protective mastic inside.  Very fake!\n\n"", ""\n\n  The only product I've actually stuck with and was using everyday for dry skin. Well low and behold about 4 werks later I noticed my under eye wrinkles and puffiness was much less noticeable.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Great humectant. I use this after I cleanse my face and before I put on moisturizer and it works amazingly to lock in moisture. I was getting peeling on my face from the chemical exfoliants I was using and the cold weather and this completely cleared it up. I have combo - dry skin in winter and combo - oily skin in summer. It doesn't clog my pores or break me out and there's no fragrance! This one is much better than the other formula as that one has fragrance and did cause irritation on my skin.\n\n"", ""\n\n  I didn't even try it because it doesn't come with a safety seal which is just unacceptable for the wide opening it has. I find it anti-hygienic and to be fair this way the cream can be substituted by anything really if you think about it.  I am pretty sure European Union has these regulations, at least all the creams I have ever bought here has those covers and since Norway is not a EU member state, I can see that they wouldn't have to obey these regulations.\n\n"", ""\n\n  Good product for very dry skin but need to be using it longer for results. Its not a very big pot it won't last long using it 2 x daily.\n\n"", '\n\n  The product package came quite ruined (even had some black marks inside), as if it were a very old box.I gave it the benefit of the doubt of the box being ruined during delivery (although it was all wrapped up so struggle to believe that anyway) but there was also no sticker that closed it permanently.I opened the product and there is no protection whatsoever, not even a smaller lid on top of the cream .There’s literally no way for me to know that this cream is new when all the signs suggest the opposite!!!Unacceptable for a beauty product that people are supposed to put on their faces.\n\n', '\n\n  There is no any protection what’s so ever ,no sealed no any small paper or cup on the cream to see it’s new , absolutely looks like been used before or ho now maybe that’s even not the right product inside ,very unhappy.There wasn’t even any sticker or something,and it was so easy to open ,of corse it’s not new ,for this price I got used products great 👍\n\n']"

","['\n\n  Its soap, why are you reading this. Wait, why am I writing this.\n\n', ""\n\n  I read the other reviews on this product, and although it seems glaringly obvious to me, I noticed a lot of people complaining that there's only 3 bars. I believe I spent $1.73 on this or so, and to expect more than 3 bars for that price is a little strange...Anyways, it's soap, it smells good, and it cleans my hands well. Not sure why anyone reads the reviews for these, I guess I did, so who knows.I guess in case you're wondering, I ordered the soap to qualify for free shipping with another item.\n\n"", '\n\n  I first began using this prior to a surgery, but then I started using it regularly.  It does reduce the number of skin infections on any given body part, which is a huge advantage.  The scent is not overpowering, and it is a ""hard"" milled soap, so it lasts longer than other bar soap that is filled with air.\n\n', '\n\n  From the moment I opened the package I could smell the wonderful aromatic fragrance of the dial soap! It was so enticing I had to rip the package right open and jump in the shower! Let me tell you I was not disappointed! As advertised this soap left me smelling fresh and deodorized all day long! I can’t wait to shower again! Package comes with four bars, each individually wrapped!\n\n', ""\n\n  As always, exactly what the doctor ordered! Since having infections for a year straight in 2009, my infectious disease doctor said to use Dial Gold and it will take care of 95% of the problem. It definitely has, too! No hospital stays, office visits weekly and more. I am convinced that it is the best and I don't want to take any chances! Besides it has a great clean and fresh scent.\n\n"", '\n\n\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \xa0I had never used this soap before, but the good price and characteristics pushed me to buy.From the pros, I can say that the soap is antibacterial and has a very good smell. It is not aromatic of course, but not repulsive. You can wash not only your hands, but also your body. Foam well on a washcloth.Of the minuses, I want to note that the package of 3 pieces of soap was torn. I believe that initially a larger package was taken with a large number of pieces of soap and was repaired for me in the form of 3 pieces.----------Nevertheless, I am satisfied with the price and quality of this soap.Will definitely order again.\n\n', '\n\n  Package came ripped and a few soaps were opened. Soaps also seemed deformed and I live in New York where the weather is below 60 degrees\n\n', ""\n\n  These are the lowest priced anti-bacterial soap you can get. Not very great packaging and won't give you confidence by seeing from outside but give it a try.1. Decent scent. There are other anti-bacterial with the intense smell but these have a moderate scent2. Makes good enough lather.3. Last long as it doesn’t over melts in water.It just lacks little moisturizing effect but Definitely value for money.\n\n"", '\n\n  An old favourite, so pleased to be able to buy it in UK now. Best all round soap I have ever used.\n\n', ""\n\n  i use to use Gamofen until they banned it have been trying different brands for me this doesn't seem to work so keep trying\n\n"", ""\n\n  Not too bad as far as deodorant soaps go, except I suspect I have been sent some old stock because it falls apart way too easily when it gets wet and it has very little fragrance.  Pity, because I quite like it.  Anyway, I think you're far better off with Irish Spring!\n\n""]"

","['\n\n  I wasn\'t offered any kind of compensation for this review.  At 68 years old I can testify that I am an experienced skin care shopper. I purchased many expensive facial skin brands; I also tried ""all natural"" unknown brands online and inexpensive drugstore sold facial creams and I have never found a skin care line in the likes of ""Tree of Life.""Tree of Life serums deliver what they promise. My skin has never looked this beautiful since before I began my menopausal years. My pores are shrinking, and my wrinkles are gently smoothing out. It is by far the very best skin care line on the market. My two daughters who are young moms have begun using Tree of Life products and several of my ""mature"" friends have begun using this line as well. I suggest you begin with the Anti-Aging Serum Combo Pack and go from there. You will notice a significant improvement within just a couple of weeks. I have absolutely nothing to gain by writing this positive review. I just want to share with you my experience with the Tree of Life products and hopefully you can benefit from it if too. You will not regret it, I promise.\n\n', '\n\n  Ok look at my eyes yall!.. seriously this system is amazing. I used it with another eye cream to boost effects and just WOW!!.. I am 51 years old and have fair sensitive skin it did not irritate my skin or delicate skin near my eyes. I LOVE IT.. You wont be sorry\n\n', ""\n\n  I ordered this set last Friday, May 17. They arrived the following Monday.  I've been using another brand of retinol and vitamin c for two months at least. As part of my cleansing routine, I wash with Cetaphil and follow up with a dab of each serum--allowing each one to absorb into the skin before adding the next. On Wednesday, I walked past my office mirror and noticed almost immediately that I didn't see my resident deep, laugh line crease on my chin. I figured it was lighting and shadows playing tricks on my eyes. This morning, I decided to do my routine as usual but document my results.BAAAABBBYYY.....that Hyaluronic acid is the truth!! All three of the products feel great on my skin. Super hydrating  but that Hyaluronic Acid is stellar!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Ok, I’m 32 with and I’ve battled acne and redness since about I was about 20. This year I cut dairy (my daily 16 oz Unsweet latte was half the problem) and I started working out much more frequently and eating lots of nutrients (veggies especially) and making my own daily drinking bone broth for the collagen support. STILL...my face showed some smile lines and I could see the beginnings of aging - like tiny lines around eyes, dull skin starting to lose its plumpness, and still a  scattering of acne (way better, but still annoying). I did monthly facials and bought a very expensive line of vitamin c serums, moisturizers etc. one year later and I quit the products and the facials because I honestly couldn’t see a difference.On a whim I ordered these serums.OMG! I have never had softer, clearer, smoother skin and I’ve only been using them a week. I haven’t even tried their other products yet (ordered them yesterday though!) my skin looks better this week than it has since my teens (oddly my skin issues waited till 20s to show up).I use the Retinol every other night, vitamin c every morning and the in between nights. Hyaluronic acid layered on top. For now I’m just putting my Vintage Traditions tallow balm on top of the serums, but I’m anxious to try their moisturizers.I can’t emphasize enough how happy I am with this product!I will update this review in two months and let you all know if it’s still as amazing as it seems one week in and if adding the other products made a difference.I know this review is long, but I struggled with skin for so long and I feel like I’ve finally found the right combo of products and diet and stress management (gym/yoga) and I want to tell everyone who suffers from acne and/or skin issues!UPDATE: May 2019I've used these products for nearly three months. I am still very happy with them. I use the Vitamin C moisturizer and eye gel on top of the serums in the day and at night I use the Retinol cream. they are fantastic. I barely get acne anymore and when I do cheat and eat a bunch of dairy - these make my skin clear from the inevitable outbreak at least twice as fast. I think is the one of the best lines I have used on my skin. My skin is younger looking and much less red. I am very happy with these!!\n\n"", ""\n\n  Backstory: I'm a 34 year old white female and have been living with hyper-pigmentation on my forehead for about 6 years. The Little patch between my eyebrows grew to take over my whole forehead. And I have minor lines and wrinkles.I've been using these in combination with a derma roller for about 1 month now.Every morning: vitamin c serum followed by hyaluronic acid serumEvery night: retinol serum followed by hyaluronic acid serum2x per week I use the derma roller at night before applying the serums.I've made it a point to not look at my face too closely over the past month while trying this product. But tonight I took more than a glance in the mirror and noticed that a bit more than a quarter sized spot of my hyper-pigmentation is gone!! I really wish I had taken before pictures because this is amazing! It gives me hope that if I stick with it, I may be able to get rid of it all!\n\n"", '\n\n  So far so good. I bought these 3 serums For the intention of maintaining and improving my rosacea and blemish skin / redness. And upon receiving I did the Retinol and Hyaluronic acid serums last night and woke up to a fairly nice glowing skin. With minimal redness so at least I know it’s not irritating the skin, and hopefully over time it’ll improve further.Texture is quite sticky but I think that’s mostly my application too, I always do overly generous amounts.The service and communication has been flawless so far, so I’m very pleased with my purchase and buying experience.I’ve uploaded my pic to monitor progress as of today. But as you can see a nice healthy glow to the skin at the moment.\n\n', '\n\n  Bought these for my wife and she is very impressed with them, said they are showing better results than the previous ones more expensive she used before and her skin feels cleaner and smoother.\n\n', '\n\n  It’s too early to say it’s working, but for the past 5 days evening and night I have used this trio religiously.After doing a little research, I found out that vitamin c serum is best used in the morning followed by hyaluronic acid serum then your favourite moisturiser, and evening is best with the retinol serum followed by hyaluronic acid serum then your favourite night moisturiser.So far my skin feels well hydrated and I’m very happy with all three products, the hyaluronic acid has a slight scent of rose which is pleasant and not too strong.My skin does feel a little tacky to the touch, but after 30 minutes when my moisturiser has been absorbed this goes away.Will be happy to update my review after a couple of months use :)\n\n', ""\n\n  The serums are good quality for the price, with very pretty packaging. Pleasant scent and consistency, easy to apply just the right amount with the dropper. The consistency is jelly-like which ensures that the serum doesn't drip all over the place. The serums contain good additional ingredients such as green tea and aloe which help ease the irritation from the active ingredients. I haven't experienced any side effects or dryness from using them so far. I only wish the percentage of the active ingredient was disclosed on the bottle. Also, the directions are a little misleading as they suggest to apply retinol daily which can be irritating to sensitive skin. Other than those two things, the serums seem to be effective so far so I will continue using them.\n\n"", ""\n\n  After hearing that the best skincare routine you can have is vitamin C in the morning and retinol in the evening I decided to bite the  bullet and get some. I ordered these as the price and reviews were great and they arrived quickly. I am only on day 3 but my skin is extremely soft and looking very healthy already so I'm looking forward to seeing the results after a longer time.\n\n""]"
